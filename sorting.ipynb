The output should be sorted as `[0]*100 + [1]*100 + [2]*100`.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including edge cases, performance considerations, and specific patterns that could affect the sorting logic."

This tests the scenario where no moves can be made, expecting an output of `[0, 0]`.\n\n2. **Maximum Distance Between Stones**:\n   - Input: `a = 1, b = 50, c = 100`\n   - Description: The stones are positioned at the extremes of the allowed range. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle large gaps, expecting an output of `[2, 3]`.\n\n3. **Two Stones Close Together, One Far Apart**:\n   - Input: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 100`\n   - Description: Tests the case where two stones are adjacent and one is far away. The expected output is `[1, 2]`, as one move can make them consecutive.\n\n4. **Stones in Reverse Order**:\n   - Input: `a = 5, b = 3, c = 1`\n   - Description: Tests if the function correctly handles input where stones are not sorted. The expected output is `[1, 2]`, similar to the sorted case.\n\n5. **Stones with One Position Gap**:\n   - Input: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 4`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario where two stones are consecutive and one is just one position away. The expected output is `[1, 1]`, as only one move is needed.\n\n6. **All Stones at Maximum Values**:\n   - Input: `a = 98, b = 99, c = 100`\n   - Description: Tests the upper boundary of the input constraints. The expected output is `[0, 0]`, as they are already consecutive.\n\n7. **Stones with Maximum Possible Gaps**:\n   - Input: `a = 1, b = 50, c = 99`\n   - Description: Tests a scenario with a large gap between the stones. The expected output is `[2, 3]`, as multiple moves are needed to make them consecutive.\n\n8. **Stones with Minimum and Maximum Values**:\n   - Input: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 100`\n   - Description: Tests the edge case where one stone is at the minimum value and another at the maximum value. The expected output is `[1, 2]`, as one move can bring them closer.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance edge cases, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution."

        "To solve the problem of moving stones until they are in consecutive positions, we can follow these steps:",

        "1. **Sort the Positions**: Since the positions of the stones are given as three distinct integers, we first sort them. This allows us to easily identify the leftmost (smallest), middle, and rightmost (largest) positions. Let's denote them as `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively.",
        "",

If the distance between `x` and `y` is greater than 1, and the distance between `y` and `z` is also greater than 1, we can move stones to fill in both gaps. If there's a gap of 1 or less between any two stones, it means they are already consecutive, and we can only make one valid move if there are still unoccupied positions.",
        "   - **Minimum Moves**: The minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive can be derived from the gaps. If the stones are already consecutive, no moves are needed. If there is one gap of 2 (e.g., `1, 2, 4`), then only one move is needed. If the gaps are both of size 1 or if they are already consecutive, then no moves are needed.",

This tests the simplest case where sorting is trivial.\n\n3. **Single Element in arr1 Not in arr2**:\n   - Input: `arr1 = [5], arr2 = [10]`\n   - Description: `arr1` contains an element that is not in `arr2`. This tests the function's ability to handle elements that should be sorted to the end.\n\n4. **All Elements in arr2**:\n   - Input: `arr1 = [3, 2, 1], arr2 = [1, 2, 3]`\n   - Description: All elements of `arr1` are present in `arr2`.

If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.\n\nYou are given an array of strings votes which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.\n\nReturn a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: votes = [&quot;ABC&quot;,&quot;ACB&quot;,&quot;ABC&quot;,&quot;ACB&quot;,&quot;ACB&quot;]\nOutput: &quot;ACB&quot;\nExplanation: \nTeam A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place, so team A is the first team.\nTeam B was ranked second by 2 voters and ranked third by 3 voters.\nTeam C was ranked second by 3 voters and ranked third by 2 voters.\nAs most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team, and team B is the third.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: votes = [&quot;WXYZ&quot;,&quot;XYZW&quot;]\nOutput: &quot;XWYZ&quot;\nExplanation:\nX is the winner due to the tie-breaking rule. X has the same votes as W for the first position, but X has one vote in the second position, while W does not have any votes in the second position. \n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: votes = [&quot;ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK&quot;]\nOutput: &quot;ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK&quot;\nExplanation: Only one voter, so their votes are used for the ranking.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= votes.length <= 1000\n\t1 <= votes[i].length <= 26\n\tvotes[i].length == votes[j].length for 0 <= i, j < votes.length.\n\tvotes[i][j] is an English uppercase letter.\n\tAll characters of votes[i] are unique.\n\tAll the characters that occur in votes[0] also occur in votes[j] where 1 <= j < votes.length.\n\n"

The output should be sorted alphabetically since all teams are tied.\n\n3. **Maximum Size with Unique Votes**:\n   - **Input**: `votes = [\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"] * 1000`\n   - **Description**: Test the upper limit of the input size with 1000 identical votes. The output should be the same string as the input.\n\n4. **Ties Resolved by Second Position**:\n   - **Input**: `votes = [\"ABC\", \"ACB\", \"BAC\", \"BCA\", \"CAB\", \"CBA\", \"AAZ\", \"ABA\"]`\n   - **Description**: A scenario where teams A and B tie in the first position, but team A has more second-place votes.

The expected output should be 0 since preparing any dish would yield a negative total.\n\n4. **All Dishes with Zero Satisfaction**:\n   - **Input**: `satisfaction = [0, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where all dishes have a satisfaction level of zero.

The output should reflect the correct order based on length.\n\n7. **Leading and Trailing Spaces**:\n   - Input: `\"  Hello world  \"`\n   - Description: Tests the function's handling of leading and trailing spaces. The output should correctly format the sentence without extra spaces.\n\n8. **Case Sensitivity**:\n   - Input: `\"A quick brown Fox jumps\"`\n   - Description: Tests the function's handling of case sensitivity. The output should ensure that the first word is capitalized correctly while maintaining the order of words based on length.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations that are crucial for validating the correctness and efficiency of the solution."

This tests how the function handles extreme values and the calculation of the mean after removing the extremes.\n\n5. **Array with Negative Values**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [-10, -5, -1, 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`\n   - **Description**: An array containing negative values. This tests if the function can handle negative numbers correctly, even though the problem states that `arr[i] >= 0`.\n\n6. **Array with Duplicates and Extremes**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 100]`\n   - **Description**: An array with many duplicates"

This tests if the algorithm correctly identifies that there is no vertical area between points.\n\n3. **Points with Large Gaps**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[1, 1], [5, 2], [10, 3]]`\n   - **Description**: Points with large gaps between them. This tests if the algorithm can identify the maximum width correctly when there are significant distances.\n\n4. **Points with Duplicate X-Coordinates**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[1, 1], [1, 2], [3, 3], [3, 4]]`\n   - **Description**: Points that have duplicate x-coordinates.

This tests the basic functionality of the algorithm with the minimum number of digits.\n\n2. **All Digits Identical**:\n   - **Input**: `num = \"11111\", k = 1`\n   - **Description**: All digits are the same. This tests how the algorithm handles cases where no wonderful integers can be formed.\n\n3. **Leading Zeros**:\n   - **Input**: `num = \"00012\", k = 1`\n   - **Description**: The input contains leading zeros. This tests if the algorithm correctly identifies the next permutation while considering the leading zeros.\n\n4. **Maximum Length Input**:\n   - **Input**: `num = \"9876543210\" * 100, k = 1000`\n   - **Description**: A very large input string (1000 digits). This tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm under maximum constraints.\n\n5. **Multiple Swaps Required**:\n   - **Input**: `num = \"54321\", k = 1`\n   - **Description**: The digits are in descending order. This tests the algorithm's ability to calculate the minimum swaps needed to reach the next permutation.\n\n6. **Duplicates with Different Positions**:\n   - **Input**: `num = \"112233\", k = 3`\n   - **Description**: The input contains duplicate digits. This tests how the algorithm handles permutations with repeated elements.\n\n7. **K Exceeds Possible Permutations**:\n   - **Input**: `num = \"12345\", k = 10`\n   - **Description**: The value of k exceeds the number of possible wonderful integers. This tests if the algorithm can handle cases where k is larger than the number of valid permutations.\n\n8. **Already Sorted Input**:\n   - **Input**: `num = \"12345\", k = 1`\n   - **Description**: The input is already in ascending order. This tests if the algorithm can correctly identify the next permutation without unnecessary swaps.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive test suite for the problem."

        "There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a unique color. You are given a 2D integer array segments, where segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori] represents the half-closed segment [starti, endi) with colori as the color.\n\nThe colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors.\n\n\n\tFor example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6}.\n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set.\n\nYou want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment [leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.\n\n\n\tFor example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:\n\n\t\n\t\t[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and second segments.\n\t\t[4,7) is colored {7} from only the second segment.\n\t\n\t\n\n\nReturn the 2D array painting describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are not painted).

Should the solution handle cases where the `salary` column contains negative values or zero, and how should these be treated in the context of distinct salaries?\n\n3. In the case of ties, how should the distinct salaries be determined? For example, if two employees have the same salary, should that salary be counted only once or multiple times?\n\n4. What should the output format be if there are less than `n` distinct salaries? Is returning `null` the only acceptable output, or should it be formatted in a specific way (e.g., as an empty result set)?\n\n5.
