        "To solve the problem of counting atoms in a chemical formula, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the nested structures (parentheses) and the counts of atoms. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:",
        "",
        "1. **Use a Stack**: We will use a stack to handle the nested structures. When we encounter an opening parenthesis '(', we push a new dictionary onto the stack to start counting the atoms within that scope. When we encounter a closing parenthesis ')', we pop the dictionary from the stack, multiply its counts by any number that follows the parentheses, and merge it back into the previous level's dictionary.",

        "    - Iterate through each character in the formula.",

        "    - If we encounter '(', we push a new dictionary onto the stack to start a new scope for nested atoms.",
        "    - If we encounter ')', we pop the last dictionary and apply any multiplier that follows it.",
        "",

This checks the basic comparison without backspacing.\n\n4. **Multiple Backspaces**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abc###\"`, `t = \"a\"`\n   - Description: The first string has multiple backspaces that should reduce it to an empty string, while the second string remains \"a\".

This checks if the function correctly handles backspacing on an already empty string.\n\n6. **Different Characters with Backspaces**:\n   - Input: `s = \"ab#c\"`, `t = \"ab#d\"`\n   - Description: Both strings reduce to \"ac\" and \"ad\" respectively after backspacing. This tests the function's ability to compare strings that become equal after backspacing.\n\n7. **Long Strings with Interspersed Backspaces**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abc#d#e#f#g\"`, `t = \"ab#c#d#e#f#g\"`\n   - Description: Both strings have a series of characters and backspaces.

The output should be the element itself.\n\n2. **All Elements Identical**:\n   - Input: `arr = [7, 7, 7, 7]`\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles arrays where all elements are the same. The expected output should be calculated based on the number of subarrays formed.\n\n3. **Increasing Order**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles an array where elements are in strictly increasing order. The minimums will always be the first element of each subarray.\n\n4. **Decreasing Order**:\n   - Input: `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles an array where elements are in strictly decreasing order. The minimums will always be the last element of each subarray.\n\n5. **Mixed Values with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `arr = [2, 1, 2, 1]`\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles an array with mixed values and duplicates. It ensures that the minimums are correctly calculated for overlapping subarrays.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Array**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, ..., 30000]` (an array of size 30,000 with increasing integers)\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum allowed input size. It checks for efficiency and whether the function can handle large inputs without timing out.\n\n7. **Array with Maximum Values**:\n   - Input: `arr = [30000, 30000, 30000]`\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles the maximum possible values for elements in the array. It checks if the function can handle large numbers correctly.\n\n8. **Array with Zeroes**:\n   - Input: `arr = [0, 0, 0]`\n   - Description: Although the constraints specify that `1 <= arr[i]`, testing with zeroes (if allowed) would check how the function handles edge cases with minimum values. \n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a robust testing strategy for the problem."

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Maximum Width Ramp\" problem:\n\n1. **Minimum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2]`\n   - **Description**: The smallest valid input size. This tests if the function can handle the minimum constraints and still return a valid output.\n\n2. **All Elements Equal**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5, 5, 5, 5]`\n   - **Description**: All elements are the same. This tests if the function correctly identifies that any pair (i, j) will yield a valid ramp width, and it should return the maximum width.\n\n3. **Strictly Decreasing Order**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A case where no valid ramp exists. This tests if the function can correctly return 0 when there are no pairs (i, j) that satisfy the ramp condition.\n\n4. **Single Valid Ramp**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 0, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Contains only one valid ramp (0, 3). This tests if the function can correctly identify and calculate the width of a single ramp.\n\n5. **Multiple Ramps with Different Widths**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 3, 2, 4, 0, 5]`\n   - **Description**: Multiple ramps exist with varying widths. This tests if the function can find the maximum width among multiple valid pairs.\n\n6. **Large Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0] * 50000 + [1]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the function with the maximum input size, where all elements are the same except the last one. This checks if the function can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n7. **Zeros and Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description**: Contains zeros and a single larger number. This tests if the function can correctly identify ramps when zeros are involved and ensure it returns the correct width.\n\n8. **Ramp at the Ends**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5]`\n   - **Description**: Valid ramps exist at both ends of the array. This tests if the function can correctly identify ramps that span the entire range of the array.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution's robustness."

If it is, we have found the next greater node for that index, and we can pop it from the stack and record the value.

Ensure that only one item can be pushed, and subsequent pushes are ignored. Verify that popping returns the correct values.\n\n2. **Empty Stack Operations**:\n   - **Input**: `DinnerPlates(2); D.pop(); D.popAtStack(0);`\n   - **Description**: Test the behavior of pop and popAtStack when all stacks are empty. Both operations should return -1.\n\n3. **Pushing Beyond Capacity**:\n   - **Input**: `DinnerPlates(2); D.push(1); D.push(2); D.push(3); D.push(4); D.push(5);`\n   - **Description**: Verify that when the maximum capacity is reached, new pushes go to the next stack.

The expected output is `\"fbcdea\"`.\n\n6. **Long String with Multiple Parentheses**:\n   - Input: `\"(abc(de(fg)h)i)j\"`\n   - Description: Tests the performance and correctness with a longer string and multiple nested parentheses. The expected output is `\"jihgfedcba\"`.\n\n7. **String with No Parentheses**:\n   - Input: `\"abcdef\"`\n   - Description: Tests the case where there are no parentheses at all.

Additionally, we need to propagate the increment value to the next element down the stack (if there is one).",

This tests if the function can handle the minimum constraints correctly.\n\n2. **Target Equals n**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `n = 5`\n   - **Description**: A straightforward case where the target array includes all numbers from 1 to n. This tests if the function can push all elements without needing any pops.\n\n3. **Target with Gaps**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 3, 5]`, `n = 5`\n   - **Description**: This tests the scenario where the target skips some numbers. The function should correctly pop the skipped numbers while pushing the target numbers.\n\n4. **Target Length Equals Maximum**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 2, ..., 100]`, `n = 100`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the target length. This checks if the function can handle the maximum constraints efficiently.\n\n5. **Target Length Less Than n**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, `n = 15`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where the target is significantly shorter than n. The function should be able to handle more elements in the stream than are needed in the target.\n\n6. **Target with Only One Element**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [50]`, `n = 100`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where the target consists of a single element. This checks if the function can correctly push and pop elements to reach a single target value.\n\n7. **Target Contains Maximum Value**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]`, `n = 100`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where the target has a maximum value at the end. The function should be able to handle pushing and popping correctly to reach the last target number.\n\n8. **Performance Case with Large Gaps**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `n = 100`\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance of the function when there are large gaps between the target numbers. The function should efficiently manage the stack operations while skipping many numbers in the stream."

The expected output should be `[0]` since there is no one to the right.\n\n2. **Two Elements with Increasing Heights**:\n   - **Input**: `heights = [1, 2]`\n   - **Description**: A case where the heights are in strictly increasing order. The expected output should be `[1, 0]` since the first person can see the second, and the second can see no one.\n\n3. **Two Elements with Decreasing Heights**:\n   - **Input**: `heights = [2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A case where the heights are in strictly decreasing order. The expected output should be `[0, 0]` since neither person can see anyone to their right.\n\n4. **All Heights Equal to Maximum**:\n   - **Input**: `heights = [100000] * 100000`\n   - **Description**: Although the problem states heights are distinct, testing with the maximum constraints (if allowed) can help ensure performance. This case should be adjusted to use unique values, but it's a reminder to check performance with large inputs.\n\n5. **Large Queue with Random Heights**:\n   - **Input**: `heights = [10, 3, 7, 5, 8, 6, 12, 11, 9, 4]`\n   - **Description**: A random arrangement of heights to assess the algorithm's ability to handle non-linear visibility.

This tests the algorithm's ability to correctly determine visibility in a non-monotonic sequence.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Queue**:\n   - **Input**: `heights = [i for i in range(1, 100001)]`\n   - **Description**: A queue with the maximum allowed size (100,000) in strictly increasing order.

This tests whether the calculator correctly follows the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n\n5. **Spaces Around Operators**: \n   - Input: `\"  6  /  3  +  2  *  5  \"`\n   - Description: An expression with extra spaces around operators and numbers. This checks if the calculator can handle and ignore whitespace correctly.\n\n6. **Maximum Length Expression**: \n   - Input: `\"1+1\"*10**5` (or similar, ensuring it reaches the maximum length of 300,000 characters)\n   - Description: A test case that pushes the length limit of the input string to ensure the function can handle the maximum size efficiently without performance degradation.\n\n7. **Division by Zero**: \n   - Input: `\"5/0\"`\n   - Description: Although the problem guarantees valid expressions, testing for division by zero is crucial in real-world scenarios to ensure the function handles such cases appropriately (e.g., throwing an error or returning a specific value).\n\n8. **Large Numbers**: \n   - Input: `\"2147483647+1\"`\n   - Description: A test case that checks how the calculator handles large integers, specifically testing the upper boundary of the integer range defined in the problem constraints.\n\nThese edge cases will help ensure that the implementation is robust, handles various scenarios correctly, and performs efficiently under different conditions."

        "On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.\n\nFunction calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n\nYou are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string &quot;{function_id}:{&quot;start&quot; | &quot;end&quot;}:{timestamp}&quot;. For example, &quot;0:start:3&quot; means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and &quot;1:end:2&quot; means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n\nA function&#39;s exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nReturn the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 2, logs = [&quot;0:start:0&quot;,&quot;1:start:2&quot;,&quot;1:end:5&quot;,&quot;0:end:6&quot;]\nOutput: [3,4]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: n = 1, logs = [&quot;0:start:0&quot;,&quot;0:start:2&quot;,&quot;0:end:5&quot;,&quot;0:start:6&quot;,&quot;0:end:6&quot;,&quot;0:end:7&quot;]\nOutput: [8]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\nFunction 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: n = 2, logs = [&quot;0:start:0&quot;,&quot;0:start:2&quot;,&quot;0:end:5&quot;,&quot;1:start:6&quot;,&quot;1:end:6&quot;,&quot;0:end:7&quot;]\nOutput: [7,1]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 100\n\t2 <= logs.length <= 500\n\t0 <= function_id < n\n\t0 <= timestamp <= 109\n\tNo two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\tNo two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\tEach function has an &quot;end&quot; log for each &quot;start&quot; log.\n\n"

The output should correctly represent the nested structure.\n\n5. **Deeply Nested Lists**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"[[[[1]]]]\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the parser's ability to handle deeply nested lists. This checks for proper recursion and depth handling.\n\n6. **Large Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"[\" + \",\".join([\"100000\" for _ in range(50000)]) + \"]\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the parser with a maximum input size of 50,000 elements, all being the integer 100,000. This checks if the parser can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n7. **Duplicate Values**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"[1,1,1]\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the parser handles duplicate integers in a list. The output should correctly represent the list with three elements, all being the integer 1.\n\n8. **Mixed Positive and Negative Values**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"[-1,[2,-3,[4,5]],6]\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a nested structure that includes both positive and negative integers. This checks if the parser can correctly differentiate and represent both types of values within the nested lists."

Although the problem states these will not be called on an empty stack, it's important to ensure that the implementation correctly handles this assumption.\n\n2. **Single Element Stack**:\n   - Push a single element (e.g., `5`) onto the stack and call `top()` and `getMin()`. This tests the basic functionality of the stack when it contains only one element.\n\n3. **Duplicate Values**:\n   - Push multiple duplicate values (e.g., `3, 3, 3`) onto the stack and then call `getMin()`. This checks if the stack correctly identifies the minimum value when duplicates are present.\n\n4. **Negative and Positive Values**:\n   - Push a mix of negative and positive values (e.g., `-1, 2, -3, 4`) and call `getMin()` after each push. This tests the stack's ability to handle a range of integer values and correctly identify the minimum.\n\n5. **Sequential Push and Pop**:\n   - Push a series of values (e.g., `1, 2, 3, 4`) and then pop them all off. After each pop, check if `getMin()` returns the correct minimum value before and after each pop operation.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Stack**:\n   - Test the stack's behavior when it reaches the maximum allowed size (e.g., `30,000` elements). This checks the performance and stability of the implementation under maximum load.\n\n7. **Alternating Min Values**:\n   - Push a sequence of values that alternate between a new minimum and a higher value (e.g., `5, 1, 6, 0, 7`). After each push, call `getMin()` to ensure it always returns the correct minimum.\n\n8. **Push and Pop Until Empty**:\n   - Continuously push and pop elements until the stack is empty, then reinitialize the stack and push new values. This tests the stack's ability to reset and function correctly after being emptied.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases related to stack size, value types, and the behavior of the stack under different conditions."

And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\n\tThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\n\tCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: code = &quot;<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>&quot;\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: code = &quot;<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>&quot;\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> &quot;<DIV>&quot;\nend_tag -> &quot;</DIV>&quot;\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> &quot;>>  ![cdata[]] &quot;\ncdata -> &quot;<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>&quot;, where the CDATA_CONTENT is &quot;<div>]>&quot;\ntext2 -> &quot;]]>>]&quot;\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT &quot;<DIV>>>&quot; is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT &quot;<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>&quot; is because of the rule 7.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: code = &quot;<A>  <B> </A>   </B>&quot;\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If &quot;<A>&quot; is closed, then &quot;<B>&quot; must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= code.length <= 500\n\tcode consists of English letters, digits, &#39;<&#39;, &#39;>&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;!&#39;, &#39;[&#39;, &#39;]&#39;, &#39;.&#39;, and &#39; &#39;.\n\n"
