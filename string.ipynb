This checks if the function can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n6. **Zigzag Pattern with Odd Number of Rows**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMN\"`, `numRows = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests the zigzag conversion with an odd number of rows and ensures that the characters are placed correctly in the zigzag pattern.\n\n7. **Zigzag Pattern with Even Number of Rows**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMN\"`, `numRows = 4`\n   - **Description**: Similar to the previous case but with an even number of rows. This will help verify that the algorithm handles both odd and even row counts correctly.\n\n8. **All Special Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \".,;:!?\", `numRows = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests the algorithm's ability to handle strings that consist solely of special characters. This checks if the function can process non-alphabetic characters correctly.\n\nThese edge cases cover various scenarios including boundary conditions, performance considerations, and special cases that could affect the output of the zigzag conversion algorithm."

If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.\n\nFor the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tA word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.\n\tEach word&#39;s length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.\n\tThe input array words contains at least one word.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: words = [&quot;This&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;example&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;justification.&quot;], maxWidth = 16\nOutput:\n[\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This &nbsp; &nbsp;is &nbsp; &nbsp;an&quot;,\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;example &nbsp;of text&quot;,\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;justification. &nbsp;&quot;\n]\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: words = [&quot;What&quot;,&quot;must&quot;,&quot;be&quot;,&quot;acknowledgment&quot;,&quot;shall&quot;,&quot;be&quot;], maxWidth = 16\nOutput:\n[\n&nbsp; &quot;What &nbsp; must &nbsp; be&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;acknowledgment &nbsp;&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;shall be &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;\n]\nExplanation: Note that the last line is &quot;shall be    &quot; instead of &quot;shall     be&quot;, because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.\nNote that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: words = [&quot;Science&quot;,&quot;is&quot;,&quot;what&quot;,&quot;we&quot;,&quot;understand&quot;,&quot;well&quot;,&quot;enough&quot;,&quot;to&quot;,&quot;explain&quot;,&quot;to&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;computer.&quot;,&quot;Art&quot;,&quot;is&quot;,&quot;everything&quot;,&quot;else&quot;,&quot;we&quot;,&quot;do&quot;], maxWidth = 20\nOutput:\n[\n&nbsp; &quot;Science &nbsp;is &nbsp;what we&quot;,\n  &quot;understand &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;well&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;enough to explain to&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;a &nbsp;computer. &nbsp;Art is&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;everything &nbsp;else &nbsp;we&quot;,\n&nbsp; &quot;do &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;\n]\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= words.length <= 300\n\t1 <= words[i].length <= 20\n\twords[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.\n\t1 <= maxWidth <= 100\n\twords[i].length <= maxWidth"

This tests the simplest case where `b` is already a substring of `a`.\n\n2. **Single Character Repetition**:\n   - Input: `a = \"a\"`, `b = \"aaaa\"`\n   - Description: Tests the case where `b` consists of multiple repetitions of a single character from `a`. The expected output should be 4.\n\n3. **Non-Matching Characters**:\n   - Input: `a = \"abc\"`, `b = \"def\"`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario where `b` contains characters that are not present in `a`. The expected output should be -1, as it is impossible for `b` to be a substring of any repetition of `a`.\n\n4. **Partial Overlap**:\n   - Input: `a = \"abc\"`, `b = \"cabcab\"`\n   - Description: Tests a case where `b` starts with a substring that overlaps with the end of `a`. The expected output should be 3, as `a` needs to be repeated three times to include `b`.\n\n5. **Exact Match After Repetition**:\n   - Input: `a = \"abc\"`, `b = \"abcabcabc\"`\n   - Description: Tests the case where `b` is exactly three repetitions of `a`. The expected output should be 3.\n\n6. **Long Strings with No Match**:\n   - Input: `a = \"abcde\"`, `b = \"fghijklmnop\"`\n   - Description: Tests the performance with long strings where `b` contains entirely different characters than `a`. The expected output should be -1.\n\n7. **Large Input Size**:\n   - Input: `a = \"abc\" * 3333` (length 9999), `b = \"cabcabcabc\"`\n   - Description: Tests the performance with maximum input sizes. This checks if the function can handle large strings efficiently. The expected output should be 2.\n\n8. **Multiple Repetitions Needed**:\n   - Input: `a = \"xyz\"`, `b = \"xyzxyzxyzxyz\"`\n   - Description: Tests a case where `b` is a multiple repetition of `a`, requiring the function to calculate the number of repetitions correctly. The expected output should be 4.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases for input size, character matching, and performance considerations."

        "",
        "Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character &#39;\\n&#39;.\n\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\n\n\tThe string &quot;//&quot; denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n\tThe string &quot;/*&quot; denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of &quot;*/&quot; should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string &quot;/*/&quot; does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\n\n\tFor example, if the string &quot;//&quot; occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n\tSimilarly, if the string &quot;/*&quot; occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\n\n\tFor example, source = &quot;string s = &quot;/* Not a comment. */&quot;;&quot; will not be a test case.\n\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so &quot;/*&quot; outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\n\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: source = [&quot;/*Test program */&quot;, &quot;int main()&quot;, &quot;{ &quot;, &quot;  // variable declaration &quot;, &quot;int a, b, c;&quot;, &quot;/* This is a test&quot;, &quot;   multiline  &quot;, &quot;   comment for &quot;, &quot;   testing */&quot;, &quot;a = b + c;&quot;, &quot;}&quot;]\nOutput: [&quot;int main()&quot;,&quot;{ &quot;,&quot;  &quot;,&quot;int a, b, c;&quot;,&quot;a = b + c;&quot;,&quot;}&quot;]\nExplanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nThe string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\nThe line by line output code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: source = [&quot;a/*comment&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, &quot;more_comment*/b&quot;]\nOutput: [&quot;ab&quot;]\nExplanation: The original source string is &quot;a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b&quot;, where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string &quot;ab&quot;, which when delimited by newline characters becomes [&quot;ab&quot;].\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= source.length <= 100\n\t0 <= source[i].length <= 80\n\tsource[i] consists of printable ASCII characters.\n\tEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\n\tThere are no single-quote or&nbsp;double-quote in the input.\n\n"

The expected output should be `[\"int y = 20;\"]`.\n\n7. **Multiple Lines with Consecutive Comments**:\n   - **Input**: `source = [\"int z = 0;\", \"// first comment\", \"// second comment\", \"/* block comment */\", \"int w = 1;\"]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the function's ability to handle multiple consecutive comments.

More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.\n\nReturn any permutation of s that satisfies this property.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput:   order = &quot;cba&quot;, s = &quot;abcd&quot; \n\nOutput:   &quot;cbad&quot; \n\nExplanation:  &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; appear in order, so the order of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; should be &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;a&quot;.\n\nSince &quot;d&quot; does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. &quot;dcba&quot;, &quot;cdba&quot;, &quot;cbda&quot; are also valid outputs.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput:   order = &quot;bcafg&quot;, s = &quot;abcd&quot; \n\nOutput:   &quot;bcad&quot; \n\nExplanation:  The characters &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;a&quot; from order dictate the order for the characters in s. The character &quot;d&quot; in s does not appear in order, so its position is flexible.\n\nFollowing the order of appearance in order, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;a&quot; from s should be arranged as &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot;. &quot;d&quot; can be placed at any position since it&#39;s not in order. The output &quot;bcad&quot; correctly follows this rule. Other arrangements like &quot;dbca&quot; or &quot;bcda&quot; would also be valid, as long as &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot; maintain their order.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= order.length <= 26\n\t1 <= s.length <= 200\n\torder and s consist of lowercase English letters.\n\tAll the characters of order are unique.\n\n"

The output should have \"a\" at the beginning, followed by any order of the remaining characters (e.g., \"abcde\", \"abdec\", etc.).\n\n4. **Order Longer than s**:\n   - Input: `order = \"abc\"`, `s = \"a\"`\n   - Description: The order contains more characters than `s`.

The output can be any permutation of `s`, such as \"def\".\n\n7. **s Contains Characters Not in Order with Mixed Presence**:\n   - Input: `order = \"cba\"`, `s = \"abcd\"`\n   - Description: Some characters in `s` are present in `order`, while others are not. The output should respect the order for \"c\", \"b\", and \"a\" while allowing \"d\" to be placed flexibly (e.g., \"cbad\", \"bcad\", etc.).\n\n8. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `order = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"`, `s = \"zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\"`\n   - Description: Test the performance with the maximum size of `s` (200 characters) and a complete order of the alphabet. The output should be a sorted version of `s` based on the order, which would be \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\".\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases related to empty inputs, single character inputs, and performance considerations with maximum input sizes."

The expected output should be `0` since there are no words to transform.\n\n6. **All Letters of the Alphabet**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where all letters are used in one word. The expected output should be `1` since there will be only one transformation.\n\n7. **Words with Repeated Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"aaa\", \"bbb\", \"ccc\", \"abc\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where some words consist of repeated characters and one word is a combination of different characters. The expected output should be `3` as each word will produce a unique transformation.\n\n8. **Performance Case with Maximum Size**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"a\" * 12] * 100` (100 words, each consisting of 12 'a's)\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum number of words and the maximum length of each word. The expected output should be `1` since all transformations will be identical.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution's correctness and efficiency."

For example, if we have the words \"time\", \"me\", and \"bell\", the word \"me\" is a suffix of \"time\". Therefore, when constructing the reference string, we only need to include \"time\" and \"bell\", and can skip adding \"me\" entirely since it is already included in \"time\".",

This tests the basic functionality of decoding and accessing the first character.\n\n2. **Single Character Repeated**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a9\"`, `k = 9`\n   - **Description**: A case where a single character is repeated multiple times. This tests if the function can handle large repetitions correctly and access the last character.\n\n3. **Maximum Length Input**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a2b2c2d2e2f2g2h2i2j2\"`, `k = 100`\n   - **Description**: A longer string with multiple characters and digits. This tests the performance and correctness when the decoded string is large but still manageable.\n\n4. **Large k Value**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a1000000000\"`, `k = 1000000000`\n   - **Description**: A scenario where `k` is at its maximum limit. This tests the handling of large indices and ensures that the function can compute the result without generating the entire string.\n\n5. **Multiple Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abc3d2\"`, `k = 10`\n   - **Description**: A case where multiple characters are followed by digits.

        "Here are important test edge cases to consider for the \"Orderly Queue\" problem:\n\n1. **Minimum Length String (k = 1)**:\n   - Input: `s = \"a\", k = 1`\n   - Description: The smallest possible input where the string has only one character. The output should be the same as the input since no moves can change it.\n\n2. **Single Character Repeated (k = 1)**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aaaaaa\", k = 1`\n   - Description: A string consisting of the same character repeated. The output should remain unchanged as all characters are identical.\n\n3. **Maximum Length String (k = 1)**:\n   - Input: `s = \"zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\", k = 1`\n   - Description: A string of length 26 (maximum allowed) in reverse order. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle the upper limit of input size.\n\n4. **Maximum Length String (k = 1000)**:\n   - Input: `s = \"a\" * 1000, k = 1000`\n   - Description: A string of length 1000 consisting of the same character. The output should be unchanged, testing performance with the maximum string length.\n\n5. **All Characters Unique (k = 2)**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcdefg\", k = 2`\n   - Description: A string with all unique characters and `k` greater than 1. This tests the ability to rearrange characters to find the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n6. **Mixed Characters with Duplicates (k = 3)**:\n   - Input: `s = \"cbaac\", k = 3`\n   - Description: A string with mixed characters and duplicates. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle duplicates while rearranging to find the smallest string.\n\n7. **Already Sorted String (k = 1)**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcde\", k = 1`\n   - Description: A string that is already in lexicographically smallest order. The output should be the same as the input, testing if the algorithm can recognize no moves are needed.\n\n8. **Edge Case with k = Length of String**:\n   - Input: `s = \"dcba\", k = 4`\n   - Description: A string where `k` equals the length of the string. This tests if the algorithm can sort the entire string since all characters can be moved.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases for string length, character uniqueness, and the behavior of the algorithm under various conditions."

This tests if the function can handle the lower boundary of inputs.\n\n2. **Single Character Binary String**:\n   - Input: `s = \"1\", n = 1`\n   - Description: A binary string of length 1 that matches the required substring. This checks if the function correctly identifies single-character matches.\n\n3. **All Zeros**:\n   - Input: `s = \"000000\", n = 5`\n   - Description: A binary string consisting only of zeros. This tests if the function can correctly identify that no positive integers can be represented.\n\n4. **Maximum Length with All Ones**:\n   - Input: `s = \"1\" * 1000, n = 1000`\n   - Description: A binary string of maximum length filled with ones. This checks if the function can handle the upper limit of string length and correctly identify all integers from 1 to 1000 as substrings.\n\n5. **Large n with Sparse Binary String**:\n   - Input: `s = \"101010101010\", n = 10`\n   - Description: A binary string with alternating bits that does not contain all required substrings for larger values of n. This tests the function's ability to identify missing substrings in a longer range.\n\n6. **Edge Case with n Greater than Length of s**:\n   - Input: `s = \"110\", n = 7`\n   - Description: The binary string is shorter than the maximum integer represented.

The expected output should be an empty array `[]`.\n\n2. **Single Parenthesis**:\n   - Input: `\"(\"`\n   - Description: This tests the case where the input string contains only one opening parenthesis. The expected output should be `[]` since it cannot be split into two valid parentheses strings.\n\n3. **Single Pair of Parentheses**:\n   - Input: `\"()\"`\n   - Description: This tests the simplest valid parentheses string. The expected output could be `[0, 1]`, indicating one part goes to A and the other to B.\n\n4. **Balanced Nested Parentheses**:\n   - Input: `\"((()))\"`\n   - Description: This tests a case with multiple levels of nesting. The expected output could be `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`, where the first two are assigned to A and the last four to B, minimizing the maximum depth.\n\n5. **Multiple Independent Pairs**:\n   - Input: `\"()()()()\"`\n   - Description: This tests the case with multiple independent pairs of parentheses. The expected output could be `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, where each pair is split evenly.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `\"()\" * 5000` (10,000 characters total)\n   - Description: This tests the upper boundary condition where the input string is at its maximum size. The output should still be valid and efficiently computed.\n\n7. **Complex Nested Structure**:\n   - Input: `\"(()(()))\"`\n   - Description: This tests a more complex nested structure. The expected output could be `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`, where the nesting is split to minimize maximum depth.\n\n8. **Unbalanced Parentheses**:\n   - Input: `\"(()\"`\n   - Description: This tests an invalid input case where the parentheses are unbalanced. The expected output should be an indication of invalid input handling, which may not be specified in the problem but is important to consider for robustness.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including empty inputs, single elements, maximum constraints, and various valid and invalid configurations of parentheses."

The output should be the same character as there are no other substrings.\n\n3. **String with Two Distinct Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abababab\"`\n   - **Description**: A string with repeating patterns of two characters. This tests the algorithm's ability to identify the correct lexicographical order among duplicates.\n\n4. **String with Maximum Length**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"z\" * (4 * 10**5)`\n   - **Description**: A string of the maximum allowed length filled with the same character (e.g., 'z'). This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution.\n\n5. **String with Mixed Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abcxyzabc\"`\n   - **Description**: A string containing a mix of characters.

This tests if the algorithm correctly identifies the last lexicographical substring.\n\n7. **String with Duplicates at the End**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abcxyzxyz\"`\n   - **Description**: A string where the last substring is a duplicate of earlier characters. This tests the algorithm's ability to prioritize the last occurrence of the maximum substring.\n\n8. **String with Increasing and Decreasing Order**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abcdefgxyz\"`\n   - **Description**: A string where the first part is in increasing order and the last part is a distinct substring.

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Can Make Palindrome from Substring\" problem:\n\n1. **Single Character Substring**:\n   - Input: `s = \"a\"`, `queries = [[0, 0, 0]]`\n   - Description: Test with the smallest possible substring (a single character). The result should be `true` since a single character is always a palindrome.\n\n2. **Empty Substring**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abc\"`, `queries = [[1, 0, 0]]`\n   - Description: Test with an invalid substring range. The query should return `false` since the substring is empty and cannot form a palindrome.\n\n3. **All Characters Identical**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aaaaaa\"`, `queries = [[0, 5, 2]]`\n   - Description: Test with a substring where all characters are the same. The result should be `true` regardless of `ki`, as any rearrangement will still be a palindrome.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Substring**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcde\" * 20000`, `queries = [[0, 99999, 0]]`\n   - Description: Test with the maximum allowed size for `s` and a query that encompasses the entire string. The result should be `false` since it cannot be rearranged into a palindrome without replacements.\n\n5. **Multiple Odd Frequencies**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcabc\"`, `queries = [[0, 5, 1]]`\n   - Description: Test with a substring that has multiple characters with odd frequencies. The result should be `true` if `ki` allows for the necessary replacements to make it a palindrome.\n\n6. **Substrings with Insufficient Replacements**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcdefg\"`, `queries = [[0, 6, 2]]`\n   - Description: Test with a substring that cannot be rearranged into a palindrome with the given `ki`. The result should be `false` since more than 2 replacements are needed.\n\n7. **All Unique Characters**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcdefgh\"`, `queries = [[0, 7, 3]]`\n   - Description: Test with a substring where all characters are unique. The result should be `false` since it cannot form a palindrome even with replacements.\n\n8. **Large Number of Queries**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aabbcc\"`, `queries = [[0, 5, 1], [1, 4, 2], [0, 3, 0], [2, 5, 1], [0, 1, 1]]` (with many more similar queries)\n   - Description: Test with a large number of queries ("

Since it cannot be made non-palindromic by changing one character, the output should be an empty string.\n\n2. **Two Character Palindrome**:\n   - Input: `\"aa\"`\n   - Description: A simple two-character palindrome. Changing either character to a different letter should yield a non-palindrome. The expected output is `\"ab\"` (or `\"ba\"`), which is the lexicographically smallest option.\n\n3. **Even Length Palindrome with All Same Characters**:\n   - Input: `\"cccc\"`\n   - Description: An even-length palindrome where all characters are the same. Changing the first character to `'b'` results in `\"bccc\"`, which is not a palindrome and is the lexicographically smallest option.\n\n4. **Odd Length Palindrome with Unique Characters**:\n   - Input: `\"abcba\"`\n   - Description: An odd-length palindrome with unique characters. Changing the first character to `'a'` results in `\"bbcba\"`, which is not a palindrome and is the lexicographically smallest option.\n\n5. **Maximum Length Palindrome**:\n   - Input: `\"a\"*1000`\n   - Description: A palindrome consisting of 1000 characters, all being `'a'`. The output should be `\"a\"*999 + \"b\"` (i.e., changing the last character to `'b'`), which is the lexicographically smallest non-palindrome.\n\n6. **Palindrome with Mixed Characters**:\n   - Input: `\"abccba\"`\n   - Description: A typical example where multiple characters are present. The expected output is `\"aaccba\"`, which is the lexicographically smallest non-palindrome.\n\n7. **Palindrome with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `\"aabbbaa\"`\n   - Description: A palindrome with duplicate characters. Changing the first character to `'a'` results in `\"babbbaa\"`, which is not a palindrome and is the lexicographically smallest option.\n\n8. **Palindrome with No Valid Change**:\n   - Input: `\"aaaaaa\"`\n   - Description: A longer palindrome where all characters are the same. The output should be `\"aaaaab\"` (or any other character change), which is the lexicographically smallest non-palindrome.\n\nThese test cases cover various edge scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations."

The expected output is `0` since no steps are needed to make them anagrams.\n\n2. **Single Character Strings**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a\", t = \"b\"`\n   - **Description**: Both strings consist of a single character but are different. The expected output is `1` since one replacement is needed.\n\n3. **Strings with All Characters Different**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abcde\", t = \"fghij\"`\n   - **Description**: Both strings have different characters with no overlap. The expected output is `5` since all characters in `t` need to be replaced.\n\n4. **Strings with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"aabbcc\", t = \"abcabc\"`\n   - **Description**: Both strings contain the same characters but in different frequencies. The expected output is `0` since they are already anagrams.\n\n5. **Maximum Length Strings**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a\" * 50000, t = \"b\" * 50000`\n   - **Description**: Both strings are at the maximum length (50,000 characters) but consist of different characters. The expected output is `50000` since all characters in `t` need to be replaced.\n\n6. **Strings with One Character Off**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abc\", t = \"abx\"`\n   - **Description**: The strings are almost anagrams except for one character. The expected output is `1` since only one character needs to be replaced.\n\n7. **Strings with Extra Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abc\", t = \"aabbcc\"`\n   - **Description**: `t` has extra characters that are not in `s`. The expected output is `3` since three characters need to be replaced to match the frequency of characters in `s`.\n\n8. **Strings with Same Characters but Different Frequencies**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"aaabb\", t = \"ab\"`\n   - **Description**: `t` has fewer characters than `s`, and the characters in `t` are not enough to match `s`. The expected output is `3` since three additional characters need to be added or replaced in `t` to match `s`.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including edge cases with different lengths, identical strings, and maximum constraints, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution."

The expected output should also be an empty array.\n\n2. **Single Element Array**:\n   - Input: `words = [\"onlyone\"]`\n   - Description: Test the case with a single string in the array. Since there are no other strings to compare against, the expected output should be an empty array.\n\n3. **All Unique Strings with No Matches**:\n   - Input: `words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]`\n   - Description: Test an array where none of the strings are substrings of any other. The expected output should be an empty array.\n\n4. **All Strings are Substrings of One String**:\n   - Input: `words = [\"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abcd\"]`\n   - Description: Test a case where all strings are substrings of the longest string. The expected output should include all strings except the longest one.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Array with No Matches**:\n   - Input: `words = [\"a\" * 30] * 100`\n   - Description: Test the maximum size of the array (100 elements) with all strings being the same. The expected output should be an empty array since all strings are duplicates.\n\n6. **Strings with Overlapping Substrings**:\n   - Input: `words = [\"abc\", \"ab\", \"bc\", \"a\"]`\n   - Description: Test an array where some strings are substrings of others. The expected output should include \"ab\", \"a\", and \"bc\" since they are substrings of \"abc\".\n\n7. **Long Strings with Substrings**:\n   - Input: `words = [\"abcdefghij\", \"xyzabc\", \"abc\", \"mnop\"]`\n   - Description: Test with longer strings where one string is a substring of another. The expected output should include \"abc\" since it is a substring of \"abcdefghij\" and \"xyzabc\".\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case with Maximum Length Strings**:\n   - Input: `words = [\"a\" * 30] + [\"a\" * 29] * 99`\n   - Description: Test the performance when the array contains the maximum length strings (30 characters) and many duplicates. The expected output should include all instances of \"a\" * 29 since they are substrings of \"a\" * 30.\n\nThese edge cases will help ensure that the solution is robust and handles a variety of scenarios effectively."

This tests the function's ability to handle the minimum input size.\n\n2. **All Unique Characters**  \n   Input: `s = \"abcdefg\"`  \n   Output: `1`  \n   Description: A string where all characters are unique. This checks if the function correctly identifies that the maximum length of consecutive characters is 1.\n\n3. **All Same Characters**  \n   Input: `s = \"zzzzzz\"`  \n   Output: `6`  \n   Description: A string where all characters are the same. This tests if the function can handle the maximum length case correctly.\n\n4. **Mixed Characters with Maximum Consecutive Count at the End**  \n   Input: `s = \"abcdeee\"`  \n   Output: `3`  \n   Description: A string where the maximum consecutive characters appear at the end. This checks if the function can correctly identify the longest substring regardless of its position.\n\n5. **Maximum Length String with Random Characters**  \n   Input: `s = \"aabbccddeeffggghhhiiijjjj\"` (length 30)  \n   Output: `4`  \n   Description: A longer string with multiple groups of consecutive characters. This tests the function's performance and correctness with larger inputs.\n\n6. **Long String with Multiple Maximum Lengths**  \n   Input: `s = \"aaabbbcccddddeeefffggg\"`  \n   Output: `4`  \n   Description: A string that contains multiple groups of consecutive characters of varying lengths, with the longest being 4. This checks if the function can find the maximum correctly.\n\n7. **String with Alternating Characters**  \n   Input: `s = \"abababababab\"`  \n   Output: `1`  \n   Description: A string where characters alternate. This tests the function's ability to recognize that no consecutive characters exist beyond length 1.\n\n8. **String with Special Characters**  \n   Input: `s = \"aaabbbcccddddeeefffggg!!!\"`  \n   Output: `4`  \n   Description: A string that includes special characters (in this case, exclamation marks) at the end. This tests if the function can handle strings with non-alphabetic characters, although the problem specifies lowercase English letters only. This case is more about robustness against unexpected input. \n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, performance considerations, and special cases that may affect the output."

Shifting a character by&nbsp;i&nbsp;means applying the shift operations&nbsp;i&nbsp;times.\n\nRemember that any index&nbsp;j&nbsp;can be picked at most once.\n\nReturn&nbsp;true&nbsp;if it&#39;s possible to convert&nbsp;s&nbsp;into&nbsp;t&nbsp;in no more than&nbsp;k&nbsp;moves, otherwise return&nbsp;false.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: s = &quot;input&quot;, t = &quot;ouput&quot;, k = 9\nOutput: true\nExplanation: In the 6th move, we shift &#39;i&#39; 6 times to get &#39;o&#39;. And in the 7th move we shift &#39;n&#39; to get &#39;u&#39;.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: s = &quot;abc&quot;, t = &quot;bcd&quot;, k = 10\nOutput: false\nExplanation: We need to shift each character in s one time to convert it into t. We can shift &#39;a&#39; to &#39;b&#39; during the 1st move. However, there is no way to shift the other characters in the remaining moves to obtain t from s.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: s = &quot;aab&quot;, t = &quot;bbb&quot;, k = 27\nOutput: true\nExplanation: In the 1st move, we shift the first &#39;a&#39; 1 time to get &#39;b&#39;. In the 27th move, we shift the second &#39;a&#39; 27 times to get &#39;b&#39;.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5\n\t0 <= k <= 10^9\n\ts, t contain&nbsp;only lowercase English letters.\n\n"

The output should be `true` since no conversion is needed.\n\n2. **Single Character Conversion**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a\", t = \"b\", k = 1`\n   - **Description**: A single character string requires one move to convert. This tests the simplest case of conversion.\n\n3. **Maximum Length Strings with No Conversion Needed**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a\" * 100000, t = \"a\" * 100000, k = 1000000000`\n   - **Description**: Both strings are the same and at maximum length. This tests the performance of the solution with large inputs.\n\n4. **Maximum Length Strings with Maximum Moves**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a\" * 100000, t = \"z\" * 100000, k = 260000`\n   - **Description**: Each character in `s` needs to be shifted 25 times to convert to `t`. This tests if the algorithm can handle maximum shifts within the allowed moves.\n\n5. **Different Length Strings**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abc\", t = \"abcd\", k = 5`\n   - **Description**: The strings have different lengths, which should immediately return `false` since conversion is impossible.\n\n6. **All Characters Need Maximum Shifts**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"a\", t = \"z\", k = 25`\n   - **Description**: Requires the maximum shift for a single character. This tests if the algorithm correctly calculates the shifts needed.\n\n7. **Multiple Characters with Insufficient Moves**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abc\", t = \"def\", k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Each character needs to be shifted by 3, totaling 9 moves. This tests the condition where moves are insufficient.\n\n8. **Wrap-Around Conversion**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"xyz\", t = \"abc\", k = 6`\n   - **Description**: Tests the wrap-around behavior of the alphabet, where characters need to shift past 'z' to reach 'a'.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including edge cases, performance considerations, and special conditions that could affect the solution's correctness and efficiency."

This checks if the function can handle the upper limits of the operations correctly.\n\n2. **All Zeros**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"0000\", a = 5, b = 2`\n   - **Description**: All characters are the same (zero). This checks if the function can recognize that no operations will change the string and it should return \"0000\".\n\n3. **Maximum Length with Sequential Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890\", a = 1, b = 50`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and correctness of the algorithm with the maximum string length and ensures it handles large inputs efficiently.\n\n4. **Single Operation Needed**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"1234\", a = 1, b = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests a simple case where only one operation (either addition or rotation) is needed to achieve the smallest string. It checks if the algorithm can identify the optimal move.\n\n5. **No Change Possible**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"8888\", a = 1, b = 1`\n   - **Description**: All characters are the same and cannot be reduced lexicographically. This checks if the function correctly identifies that no operations will yield a smaller string.\n\n6. **Alternating Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"5050\", a = 3, b = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the algorithm's ability to handle strings with alternating digits and determine the optimal sequence of operations to achieve the smallest result.\n\n7. **Maximum Rotation with Minimum Addition**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"1234\", a = 0, b = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where addition does not change the digits (a = 0), but rotation is significant. This checks if the function can effectively use rotation alone to find the smallest string.\n\n8. **Edge Case with Large `b`**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"987654\", a = 2, b = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where `b` is large relative to the length of the string, ensuring that the algorithm correctly handles rotations"

The expected output should be `50000`, as all 'b's would need to be deleted to make it balanced.\n\n7. **Consecutive 'b's Followed by 'a's**:\n   - Input: `s = \"bbbaaa\"`\n   - Description: Tests a case where there are consecutive 'b's followed by 'a's. The expected output should be `3`, as all 'b's need to be deleted.\n\n8. **Random Imbalanced String**:\n   - Input: `s = \"bababaaab\"`\n   - Description: Tests a more complex case with a mix of 'a's and 'b's. The expected output should be `3`, as deleting the first 'b' and the last two 'a's would balance the string.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases for string length, character composition, and performance considerations."

This checks if the function can return the simplest string when the numeric value is equal to the minimum possible for the given length.\n\n3. **Maximum Length with Minimum Value**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 100000, k = 100000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of `n` with a corresponding `k` that requires all 'a's. This checks performance and efficiency for large inputs.\n\n4. **Maximum Length with Maximum Value**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 100000, k = 2600000`\n   - **Description**: The maximum possible value for `k` when `n` is at its maximum.

This tests if the function correctly returns 0 since the word cannot be a substring.\n\n5. **Word is a Substring Repeated Once**:\n   - Input: `sequence = \"abcabc\"`, `word = \"abc\"`\n   - Output: 2\n   - Description: The word appears as a substring exactly once, but can be repeated twice. This tests the function's ability to count multiple occurrences.\n\n6. **Word with Overlapping Repeats**:\n   - Input: `sequence = \"aaaaaa\"`, `word = \"aa\"`\n   - Output: 3\n   - Description: The word can overlap when repeated. This tests if the function correctly counts overlapping occurrences.\n\n7. **Maximum Length Inputs**:\n   - Input: `sequence = \"a\" * 100`, `word = \"a\" * 100`\n   - Output: 100\n   - Description: Both the sequence and word are at their maximum length, testing the performance and efficiency of the solution.\n\n8. **No Repeats but Contains Word**:\n   - Input: `sequence = \"xyzxyzxyz\"`, `word = \"xyz\"`\n   - Output: 3\n   - Description: The word appears multiple times but can only be counted as a single repeat. This tests if the function correctly identifies the maximum k-repeating value. \n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including edge cases, boundary conditions, and performance considerations."

No characters are allowed, so all words should be inconsistent.\n\n2. **Empty Words Array**:\n   - **Input**: `allowed = \"abc\"`, `words = []`\n   - **Description**: Check the function's response when the `words` array is empty. The expected output should be `0` since there are no words to evaluate.\n\n3. **Single Character Allowed**:\n   - **Input**: `allowed = \"a\"`, `words = [\"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\"]`\n   - **Description**: Test with a single character in `allowed`. Only words that consist solely of 'a' should be counted as consistent.\n\n4. **All Words Consistent**:\n   - **Input**: `allowed = \"xyz\"`, `words = [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"xy\", \"yz\", \"xyz\"]`\n   - **Description**: All words consist of characters present in `allowed`. The output should equal the length of `words`.\n\n5. **All Words Inconsistent**:\n   - **Input**: `allowed = \"abc\"`, `words = [\"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"]`\n   - **Description**: None of the words should be consistent since they all contain characters not present in `allowed`. The expected output is `0`.\n\n6. **Maximum Size of Words**:\n   - **Input**: `allowed = \"abcdefghij\"`, `words = [\"abcdefghij\"] * 10000`\n   - **Description**: Test the performance and correctness when the `words` array reaches its maximum size (10,000).

The expected output should be the same as the input, `\"12:34\"`.\n\n8. **Edge Case of Midnight**:\n   - Input: `\"0?:00\"`\n   - Description: This case tests the scenario where the hour starts with `0` and the minutes are `00`. The expected output should be `\"09:00\"` since it is the latest valid time starting with `0`.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including all hidden digits, boundary conditions, and specific cases that could lead to invalid times."

This tests the simplest case where no operations are needed since the condition of `a < b` is already satisfied.\n\n2. **Identical Strings**:\n   - Input: `a = \"aaa\"`, `b = \"aaa\"`\n   - Description: Both strings are identical. This tests the condition where both strings consist of one distinct letter, requiring a minimum of 2 operations to change one string to a different letter.\n\n3. **Strings with Maximum Length**:\n   - Input: `a = \"a\" * 100000`, `b = \"z\" * 100000`\n   - Description: Both strings are at their maximum allowed length. This tests the performance of the solution under maximum constraints and checks if it can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n4. **All Characters in `a` Greater than in `b`**:\n   - Input: `a = \"xyz\"`, `b = \"abc\"`\n   - Description: All characters in `a` are greater than those in `b`.

This tests the scenario where the second condition cannot be satisfied without significant changes.\n\n6. **Strings with Mixed Characters**:\n   - Input: `a = \"abc\"`, `b = \"cde\"`\n   - Description: Both strings have overlapping characters. This tests the algorithm's ability to find the minimum operations needed to satisfy any of the three conditions.\n\n7. **Strings with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `a = \"aabb\"`, `b = \"ccdd\"`\n   - Description: Both strings contain duplicate characters.

This tests if the function can handle the minimum input length.\n\n2. **All Unique Characters**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcdef\"`\n   - Description: A string where all characters are unique. This tests if the function correctly identifies that each character is a homogenous substring of length 1.\n\n3. **All Same Characters**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aaaaaa\"`\n   - Description: A string where all characters are the same. This tests if the function can correctly calculate the number of homogenous substrings for a long sequence of identical characters.\n\n4. **Mixed Characters with Consecutive Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aabbcc\"`\n   - Description: A string with groups of consecutive duplicates. This tests the function's ability to count homogenous substrings formed by different characters.\n\n5. **Long String with Alternating Characters**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abababababab\"`\n   - Description: A long string with alternating characters. This tests the function's performance and efficiency with larger inputs while ensuring it correctly counts substrings.\n\n6. **Maximum Length String**:\n   - Input: `s = \"a\" * 100000` (100,000 characters of 'a')\n   - Description: Tests the upper limit of the input size constraint. This checks if the function can handle and compute results for the maximum string length efficiently.\n\n7. **String with Mixed Characters and Long Sequences**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aaabbbcccaaa\"`\n   - Description: A string with multiple groups of consecutive characters.

This tests the function's performance and correctness when the majority of the string consists of a single character.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including minimum and maximum input sizes, varying character distributions, and performance considerations."

How should we handle cases where either `word1` or `word2` is empty? Should we return 0 in such cases, or is there a different expected behavior?\n\n4. Are there any specific performance requirements or time complexity constraints we should be aware of, given the maximum lengths of `word1` and `word2`?\n\n5. Should we consider the possibility of multiple valid subsequences leading to the same palindrome length, or is it sufficient to find just one valid combination to determine the maximum length?"

The expected output should be `1` since `0` is a valid integer.\n\n4. **Leading Zeros**:\n   - Input: `\"a001b002c003\"`\n   - Description: Tests how leading zeros are handled. The expected output should be `3` because `001`, `002`, and `003` are all equivalent to `1`, `2`, and `3`.\n\n5. **Maximum Length with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `\"a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6\"`\n   - Description: Tests the maximum length of the string (1000 characters) with multiple digits and letters.

The expected output should be `6` since `12`, `34`, `56`, `78`, `90` are different integers.\n\n7. **Only Letters**:\n   - Input: `\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"`\n   - Description: Tests the case where there are no digits at all. The expected output should be `0`.\n\n8. **Negative Numbers Representation**:\n   - Input: `\"a-123b456c-789d0\"`\n   - Description: Tests the handling of negative numbers represented as characters. The expected output should be `3` since only `123`, `456`, and `0` are valid integers (the negative sign is ignored).\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases, special values, and performance considerations."

This tests the function's handling of the edge case where there are no words in either sentence.\n\n2. **Single Word Sentences**:\n   - **Input**: `sentence1 = \"Hello\"`, `sentence2 = \"Hello\"`\n   - **Description**: Both sentences consist of the same single word. This checks if the function correctly identifies identical single-word sentences as similar.\n\n3. **Single Word with Extra Words**:\n   - **Input**: `sentence1 = \"Hello\"`, `sentence2 = \"Hello world\"`\n   - **Description**: The first sentence has one word and the second has the same word plus an additional one. This tests if the function can recognize that the additional word can be inserted.\n\n4. **Different Words with Similar Length**:\n   - **Input**: `sentence1 = \"cat\"`, `sentence2 = \"dog\"`\n   - **Description**: Two completely different words. This checks if the function correctly identifies that these sentences cannot be made similar.\n\n5. **Leading and Trailing Spaces**:\n   - **Input**: `sentence1 = \"  Hello  \"`, `sentence2 = \"Hello\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles leading and trailing spaces. The function should ideally reject this as invalid input since the problem states there should be no leading or trailing spaces.\n\n6. **Maximum Length Sentences**:\n   - **Input**: `sentence1 = \"word \" * 50`, `sentence2 = \"word \" * 50 + \"extra\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the function with maximum length sentences (100 characters). This checks if the function can handle larger inputs efficiently.\n\n7. **Similar Sentences with Different Word Order**:\n   - **Input**: `sentence1 = \"I love programming\"`, `sentence2 = \"I programming love\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests if the function can identify that the sentences are similar despite the different order of words, as they can be made equal by inserting words.\n\n8. **Sentences with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `sentence1 = \"hello hello world\"`, `sentence2 = \"hello world\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests if the function can handle sentences with duplicate words and still recognize them as similar, as the duplicates can be ignored when inserting.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios including edge cases, performance considerations, and special conditions that may arise in the problem domain."

        "   - If the start words match, we will check how many words from the start of each sentence can be aligned.",
        "   - Similarly, if the end words match, we will check how many words from the end can be aligned.",
        "   - If we can find a valid alignment such that the middle part of either sentence can be seen as insertable, we return `True`.",

The expected output should be `0`.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Non-Alternating String**:\n   - **Input**: A string of length `100,000` consisting of all '0's, e.g., `\"0000000000...00\"`.\n   - **Description**: Testing the performance with the maximum allowed size where all characters are the same. The expected output should be `50,000`.\n\n7. **Complex Pattern with Minimal Flips**:\n   - **Input**: `\"00110011\"`\n   - **Description**: A string that requires a few flips to become alternating. The expected output should be `2` (flipping two '0's or two '1's).\n\n8. **Flipping Required After Rotation**:\n   - **Input**: `\"1100\"` (after a rotation, it can become `\"0011\"`)\n   - **Description**: A string that requires both rotation and flips to become alternating. The expected output should be `1` (after rotating, only one flip is needed). \n\nThese test cases cover various boundary conditions, special values, and performance scenarios that are crucial for ensuring the robustness of the solution."

        "Here are several important test edge cases to consider for the problem of counting unique length-3 palindromic subsequences:\n\n1. **Minimum Length Input**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abc\"`\n   - Description: The smallest valid input string that does not contain any palindromic subsequences of length 3. This tests the lower boundary condition.\n\n2. **All Identical Characters**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aaa\"`\n   - Description: A string where all characters are the same. This should return 1, as there is only one unique palindromic subsequence (\"aaa\").\n\n3. **No Palindromic Subsequences**:\n   - Input: `s = \"xyz\"`\n   - Description: A string with no repeating characters. This tests the case where no palindromic subsequences can be formed.\n\n4. **Multiple Unique Palindromic Subsequences**:\n   - Input: `s = \"ababa\"`\n   - Description: A string that can form multiple unique palindromic subsequences. This should return 3: \"aba\", \"bab\", and \"aaa\".\n\n5. **Long String with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcabcabc\"`\n   - Description: A longer string with repeating characters. This tests performance and ensures that the function can handle larger inputs while correctly identifying unique palindromic subsequences.\n\n6. **String with Mixed Characters**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aabbcc\"`\n   - Description: A string with pairs of characters. This should return 0, as there are no unique palindromic subsequences of length 3.\n\n7. **String with Non-Adjacent Palindromic Subsequences**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abcbabc\"`\n   - Description: A string where palindromic subsequences are formed by non-adjacent characters. This should return 3: \"aba\", \"bab\", and \"cbc\".\n\n8. **Maximum Length Input**:\n   - Input: `s = \"a\" * 100000` (100,000 'a' characters)\n   - Description: A string at the upper limit of the constraint. This tests the performance of the algorithm under maximum input size, where the expected output should be 1 (\"aaa\").\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases related to the constraints of the problem, special character arrangements, and performance considerations."

This checks if the function can handle the simplest case correctly.\n\n3. **Single Element Array with Non-Matching Prefix**:\n   - Input: `s = \"hello\"`, `words = [\"world\"]`\n   - Description: The string does not match the single element in the array. This tests the function's ability to return false when the prefix is not present.\n\n4. **Array with Multiple Elements, Prefix Matches**:\n   - Input: `s = \"iloveleetcode\"`, `words = [\"i\", \"love\", \"leetcode\", \"apples\"]`\n   - Description: The string can be formed by concatenating the first three elements of the array.

The expected output should be `1`.\n\n4. **All Patterns Match**:\n   - **Input**: `patterns = [\"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\"]`, `word = \"abc\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a scenario where all patterns are substrings of the word. The expected output should be `3`.\n\n5. **Patterns with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `patterns = [\"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]`, `word = \"abc\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles duplicate patterns. The expected output should be `3` since \"a\" appears twice but counts as one match.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `patterns = [\"a\" * 100] * 100`, `word = \"a\" * 100`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and correctness with the maximum constraints. The expected output should be `100` since all patterns match.\n\n7. **No Matches**:\n   - **Input**: `patterns = [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]`, `word = \"abc\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where none of the patterns are substrings of the word. The expected output should be `0`.\n\n8. **Long Patterns with Partial Matches**:\n   - **Input**: `patterns = [\"abc\", \"bc\", \"cde\", \"de\"]`, `word = \"abcdef\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a scenario where some patterns partially match but not all. The expected output should be `3` since \"abc\", \"bc\", and \"de\" are substrings of \"abcdef\".\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including empty inputs, duplicates, maximum constraints, and varying match conditions, which are crucial for thoroughly testing the solution."

Expected output is `1`.\n\n2. **All Same Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `word = \"aaaaaa\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the word consists of repeated characters. The expected output should be equal to the length of the word since no movement is needed after the first character.\n\n3. **Maximum Length Input**:\n   - **Input**: `word = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper boundary condition with the maximum allowed length of 100 characters. This will help ensure that the solution handles larger inputs efficiently.\n\n4. **Circular Movement**:\n   - **Input**: `word = \"az\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the pointer needs to move from 'a' to 'z', which requires wrapping around the circular arrangement. Expected output is `3` (1 second to type 'a', 1 second to move to 'z', and 1 second to type 'z').\n\n5. **Alternating Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `word = \"abababab\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with alternating characters that require back and forth movement. This will check if the solution correctly calculates the time for multiple movements.\n\n6. **Maximum Distance Between Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `word = \"azbycx\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where the characters are maximally spaced apart in the circular arrangement. This will help verify that the solution correctly calculates the shortest path for each character.\n\n7. **Performance with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `word = \"abcdeedcba\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with duplicates and a back-and-forth pattern. This will check if the solution can efficiently handle repeated characters and calculate the time correctly.\n\n8. **All Characters in Reverse Order**:\n   - **Input**: `word = \"zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the word contains all characters in reverse order. This will help ensure that the solution can handle large movements in the opposite direction efficiently.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a thorough testing of the solution."

Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.\n\n\nGiven the secret number secret and your friend&#39;s guess guess, return the hint for your friend&#39;s guess.\n\nThe hint should be formatted as &quot;xAyB&quot;, where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: secret = &quot;1807&quot;, guess = &quot;7810&quot;\nOutput: &quot;1A3B&quot;\nExplanation: Bulls are connected with a &#39;|&#39; and cows are underlined:\n&quot;1807&quot;\n  |\n&quot;7810&quot;\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: secret = &quot;1123&quot;, guess = &quot;0111&quot;\nOutput: &quot;1A1B&quot;\nExplanation: Bulls are connected with a &#39;|&#39; and cows are underlined:\n&quot;1123&quot;        &quot;1123&quot;\n  |      or     |\n&quot;0111&quot;        &quot;0111&quot;\nNote that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000\n\tsecret.length == guess.length\n\tsecret and guess consist of digits only.\n\n"

For instance, if the secret is \"1111\" and the guess is also \"1111\", would that be considered 4 bulls and 0 cows?\n\n3. In the event of duplicate digits in either the secret or guess, how should we count the cows? For example, if the secret is \"1223\" and the guess is \"3211\", how many cows should be reported?\n\n4. What should the output format be if there are no bulls or cows? Should it still return \"0A0B\", or is there a different expected output?\n\n5.

This tests the basic functionality of counting bulls.\n\n2. **All Bulls Edge Case**:\n   - **Input**: `secret = \"1234\"`, `guess = \"1234\"`\n   - **Description**: Both strings are identical and contain no duplicates. This tests the scenario where all digits are bulls.\n\n3. **All Cows Edge Case**:\n   - **Input**: `secret = \"1234\"`, `guess = \"4321\"`\n   - **Description**: All digits are present but in the wrong positions. This tests the scenario where there are no bulls, only cows.\n\n4. **Mixed Bulls and Cows Edge Case**:\n   - **Input**: `secret = \"1234\"`, `guess = \"1243\"`\n   - **Description**: Some digits are in the correct position (bulls) and others are in the wrong position (cows). This tests the ability to correctly identify both bulls and cows.\n\n5. **Duplicates in Secret and Guess**:\n   - **Input**: `secret = \"1122\"`, `guess = \"2211\"`\n   - **Description**: Both strings contain duplicate digits. This tests the algorithm's handling of counting cows correctly when duplicates are involved.\n\n6. **Performance Edge Case**:\n   - **Input**: `secret = \"1234567890\" * 100`, `guess = \"0987654321\" * 100`\n   - **Description**: Both strings are at the maximum length of 1000 characters. This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution under maximum constraints.\n\n7. **No Common Digits Edge Case**:\n   - **Input**: `secret = \"1234\"`, `guess = \"5678\"`\n   - **Description**: There are no common digits between the secret and guess. This tests the scenario where both bulls and cows should be zero.\n\n8. **Single Bull with Multiple Cows Edge Case**:\n   - **Input**: `secret = \"1234\"`, `guess = \"1245\"`\n   - **Description**: One digit is in the correct position (bull), and multiple digits are present but in the wrong positions (cows). This tests the algorithm's ability to differentiate between bulls and cows correctly.\n\nThese test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases related to input size, duplicates, and the presence or absence of common digits."

The expected output is 1, as a single character is a palindrome.\n\n2. **Two Different Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"ab\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the input string has two different characters. The expected output is 1, as no palindrome longer than one character can be formed.\n\n3. **Two Identical Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"aa\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the input string consists of two identical characters. The expected output is 2, as \"aa\" is a palindrome.\n\n4. **Mixed Case Sensitivity**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"Aa\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case sensitivity of the problem.

The expected output is 2000, as the entire string is a palindrome.\n\n6. **Palindrome with Odd and Even Counts**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abccccdd\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a mix of characters with both odd and even counts. The expected output is 7, as \"dccaccd\" is a valid palindrome.\n\n7. **All Unique Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"abcdefg\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where all characters are unique. The expected output is 1, as the longest palindrome that can be formed is any single character.\n\n8. **Long String with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"aabbccddeeffgg\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a longer string with multiple pairs of characters. The expected output is 14, as \"abcdefg\" can be rearranged into a palindrome with a maximum length of 14 (using all pairs and one additional character).\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, case sensitivity, and performance considerations."

This should require 6 insertions to meet the minimum length requirement and include at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit.\n\n2. **Minimum Length with Missing Character Types**:\n   - **Input**: `\"abcde\"`\n   - **Description**: A password that is exactly 5 characters long, missing uppercase letters and digits. This should require 3 insertions to meet the length requirement and include at least one uppercase letter and one digit.\n\n3. **Exactly 6 Characters but Weak**:\n   - **Input**: `\"aaaAAA\"`\n   - **Description**: A password that meets the length requirement but has three repeating characters. This should require at least 1 replacement to break the repetition and 1 insertion to add a digit.\n\n4. **Maximum Length with All Character Types but Weak**:\n   - **Input**: `\"aaaAAA111111\"`\n   - **Description**: A password that is 12 characters long, contains all character types but has three repeating characters. This should require at least 1 replacement to break the repetition.\n\n5. **Strong Password Already**:\n   - **Input**: `\"Abc123\"`\n   - **Description**: A valid strong password that meets all criteria. The expected output should be `0` since no changes are needed.\n\n6. **Long Password with Excessive Repetition**:\n   - **Input**: `\"AaaAaaAaaAaaAaaAaaAaaAaa\"`\n   - **Description**: A long password (24 characters) that has excessive repetition of characters. This tests how the function handles long inputs and the need for multiple replacements to break the repetition.\n\n7. **Password at Maximum Length with No Changes Needed**:\n   - **Input**: `\"A1b2C3d4E5f6G7h8I9j0\"`\n   - **Description**: A valid strong password that is exactly 20 characters long. This tests the upper boundary condition where no changes are needed.\n\n8. **Password with Special Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `\"aaaAAA!!!\"`\n   - **Description**: A password that meets the length requirement but lacks digits. This should require at least 1 insertion to add a digit while also ensuring that the three repeating characters condition is addressed.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance edge cases that are critical for validating the solution to the problem."

The longest uncommon subsequence should be the length of the longest string that is not a subsequence of the others, which is 3.\n\n4. **Strings with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `[\"aaa\", \"aaa\", \"aa\"]`\n   - Description: Strings contain duplicates.

The longest uncommon subsequence should return 1.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `[\"abcdefghij\", \"abcdefghij\", \"abcdefghij\", \"abcdefghij\", \"abcdefghij\"]` (50 strings of length 10)\n   - Description: Tests the upper limit of the constraints with identical strings. The output should be -1.\n\n7. **Empty String in Input**:\n   - Input: `[\"abc\", \"\", \"def\"]`\n   - Description: Includes an empty string. The longest uncommon subsequence should be the length of the longest non-empty string, which is 3.\n\n8. **Strings with Common Prefix**:\n   - Input: `[\"abcde\", \"abc\", \"ab\"]`\n   - Description: All strings share a common prefix. The longest uncommon subsequence should be the length of the longest string that is not a subsequence of the others, which is 5.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios including edge cases related to duplicates, maximum constraints, and unique characteristics of subsequences."
