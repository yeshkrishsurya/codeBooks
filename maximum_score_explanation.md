# Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations - Detailed Logic Explanation

## Problem Understanding
The problem asks us to find the maximum score by performing multiplication operations. We can take elements from either the beginning or end of the `nums` array and multiply them with the corresponding `multipliers` array element.

## Dynamic Programming Approach Logic

### 1. **State Definition**
```python
dp[i][j] = maximum score achievable after using i multipliers, 
           where j elements were taken from the start
```

**Why this state definition?**
- `i` represents how many multipliers we've used so far
- `j` represents how many elements we've taken from the start of the array
- This uniquely identifies our current state and allows us to calculate how many elements we've taken from the end

### 2. **DP Table Initialization**
```python
dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
```
- Size is `(m+1) × (m+1)` where `m` is the number of multipliers
- Initialized to 0 because we start with no score
- `dp[0][0] = 0` represents the base case: no multipliers used, no elements taken

### 3. **State Transitions Logic**

#### For each step `i` (1 to m):
```python
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(i + 1):
```

**Why `j` goes from 0 to `i`?**
- After using `i` multipliers, we can have taken at most `i` elements from the start
- `j` represents elements taken from start, so `0 ≤ j ≤ i`

#### Two possible actions at each state:

**Action 1: Take from the start**
```python
if j > 0:  # We can take from start
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + nums[j - 1] * multipliers[i - 1])
```

**Logic:**
- `j > 0`: We can only take from start if we haven't taken all elements from start yet
- `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`: Previous state with one fewer multiplier and one fewer element from start
- `nums[j - 1]`: The j-th element from the start (0-indexed, so j-1)
- `multipliers[i - 1]`: The i-th multiplier (0-indexed, so i-1)

**Action 2: Take from the end**
```python
if j < i:  # We can take from end
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + nums[n - (i - j)] * multipliers[i - 1])
```

**Logic:**
- `j < i`: We can take from end if we haven't used all our "slots" yet
- `dp[i - 1][j]`: Previous state with one fewer multiplier but same number from start
- `nums[n - (i - j)]`: Element from the end
  - `i - j` = elements taken from end so far
  - `n - (i - j)` = position from the end

### 4. **Final Result**
```python
max_score = max(dp[m])
```
- After using all `m` multipliers, we check all possible states
- `dp[m][j]` for all `j` represents all possible final states
- We take the maximum among all these states

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `multipliers = [3, 2, 1]`

**Step-by-step DP table filling:**

1. **i=1, j=0**: Take from end
   - `dp[1][0] = dp[0][0] + nums[3-1] * multipliers[0] = 0 + 3 * 3 = 9`

2. **i=1, j=1**: Take from start  
   - `dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + nums[0] * multipliers[0] = 0 + 1 * 3 = 3`

3. **i=2, j=0**: Take from end twice
   - `dp[2][0] = dp[1][0] + nums[3-2] * multipliers[1] = 9 + 2 * 2 = 13`

4. **i=2, j=1**: Take from start once, end once
   - From start: `dp[1][0] + nums[0] * multipliers[1] = 9 + 1 * 2 = 11`
   - From end: `dp[1][1] + nums[3-1] * multipliers[1] = 3 + 3 * 2 = 9`
   - `dp[2][1] = max(11, 9) = 11`

5. **i=2, j=2**: Take from start twice
   - `dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + nums[1] * multipliers[1] = 3 + 2 * 2 = 7`

6. **i=3, j=0**: Take from end three times
   - `dp[3][0] = dp[2][0] + nums[3-3] * multipliers[2] = 13 + 1 * 1 = 14`

7. **i=3, j=1**: Take from start once, end twice
   - From start: `dp[2][0] + nums[0] * multipliers[2] = 13 + 1 * 1 = 14`
   - From end: `dp[2][1] + nums[3-2] * multipliers[2] = 11 + 2 * 1 = 13`
   - `dp[3][1] = max(14, 13) = 14`

8. **i=3, j=2**: Take from start twice, end once
   - From start: `dp[2][1] + nums[1] * multipliers[2] = 11 + 2 * 1 = 13`
   - From end: `dp[2][2] + nums[3-1] * multipliers[2] = 7 + 3 * 1 = 10`
   - `dp[3][2] = max(13, 10) = 13`

9. **i=3, j=3**: Take from start three times
   - `dp[3][3] = dp[2][2] + nums[2] * multipliers[2] = 7 + 3 * 1 = 10`

**Final result:** `max(dp[3]) = max(14, 14, 13, 10) = 14`

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m²) where m is the number of multipliers
- **Space Complexity:** O(m²) for the DP table

This approach efficiently explores all possible combinations of taking elements from the start and end while using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

## Key Insights

1. **State Representation**: The key insight is that we only need to track how many elements we've taken from the start, not which specific elements.

2. **Optimal Substructure**: Each state depends only on previous states, making it perfect for dynamic programming.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The loops and conditions ensure we don't take more elements than available or use invalid states.

4. **Memory Efficiency**: While we use O(m²) space, this is optimal for this problem as we need to track all possible states.
