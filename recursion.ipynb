        "You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.\n\nThe syntax for these expressions is given as follows.\n\n\n\tAn expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n\t(An integer could be positive or negative.)\n\tA let expression takes the form &quot;(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)&quot;, where let is always the string &quot;let&quot;, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.\n\tAn add expression takes the form &quot;(add e1 e2)&quot; where add is always the string &quot;add&quot;, there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n\tA mult expression takes the form &quot;(mult e1 e2)&quot; where mult is always the string &quot;mult&quot;, there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n\tFor this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names &quot;add&quot;, &quot;let&quot;, and &quot;mult&quot; are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n\tFinally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: expression = &quot;(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))&quot;\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: expression = &quot;(let x 3 x 2 x)&quot;\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: expression = &quot;(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))&quot;\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= expression.length <= 2000\n\tThere are no leading or trailing spaces in expression.\n\tAll tokens are separated by a single space in expression.\n\tThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\tThe expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.\n\n"

        "You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains one less block than the row beneath it and is centered on top.\n\nTo make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given&nbsp;as a list of&nbsp;three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.\n\n\n\tFor example, &quot;ABC&quot; represents a triangular pattern with a &#39;C&#39; block stacked on top of an &#39;A&#39; (left) and &#39;B&#39; (right) block. Note that this is different from &quot;BAC&quot; where &#39;B&#39; is on the left bottom and &#39;A&#39; is on the right bottom.\n\n\nYou start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid.\n\nGiven bottom and allowed, return true if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that every triangular pattern in the pyramid is in allowed, or false otherwise.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: bottom = &quot;BCD&quot;, allowed = [&quot;BCC&quot;,&quot;CDE&quot;,&quot;CEA&quot;,&quot;FFF&quot;]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.\nStarting from the bottom (level 3), we can build &quot;CE&quot; on level 2 and then build &quot;A&quot; on level 1.\nThere are three triangular patterns in the pyramid, which are &quot;BCC&quot;, &quot;CDE&quot;, and &quot;CEA&quot;. All are allowed.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: bottom = &quot;AAAA&quot;, allowed = [&quot;AAB&quot;,&quot;AAC&quot;,&quot;BCD&quot;,&quot;BBE&quot;,&quot;DEF&quot;]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.\nStarting from the bottom (level 4), there are multiple ways to build level 3, but trying all the possibilites, you will get always stuck before building level 1.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= bottom.length <= 6\n\t0 <= allowed.length <= 216\n\tallowed[i].length == 3\n\tThe letters in all input strings are from the set {&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;}.\n\tAll the values of allowed are unique.\n\n"

This will ensure that the function correctly handles operator precedence and different groupings.\n\n5. **Expression with Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `\"0*3-2\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles zero in multiplication and subtraction, which could lead to different results based on grouping.\n\n6. **Expression with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `\"1+1-1\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles duplicate numbers and operators. The output should reflect all possible results from different groupings.\n\n7. **Maximum Length Input**:\n   - **Input**: `\"1+2*3-4*5+6*7-8*9+10\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the function with the maximum allowed length of the expression. This will help ensure that the function can handle larger inputs efficiently.\n\n8. **Expression Leading to Negative Results**:\n   - **Input**: `\"1-2-3-4\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles expressions that lead to negative results. The output should include all possible negative results from different groupings.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution's correctness and efficiency."

        "## Test Edge Cases",
        "",
        "Here are some important edge cases to consider for the Minesweeper problem:\n\n1. **Single Cell Board with Mine**:\n   - Input: `board = [[\"M\"]]`, `click = [0, 0]`\n   - Description: The smallest possible board containing only a mine. This tests the basic functionality of revealing a mine.\n\n2. **Single Cell Board with Empty Square**:\n   - Input: `board = [[\"E\"]]`, `click = [0, 0]`\n   - Description: A single cell board containing an empty square. This tests the case where an empty square is revealed.\n\n3. **All Empty Board**:\n   - Input: `board = [[\"E\", \"E\"], [\"E\", \"E\"]]`, `click = [0, 0]`\n   - Description: A board with no mines at all. This tests the recursive revealing of empty squares.\n\n4. **Board with No Adjacent Mines**:\n   - Input: `board = [[\"E\", \"E\", \"E\"], [\"E\", \"E\", \"E\"], [\"E\", \"E\", \"E\"]]`, `click = [1, 1]`\n   - Description: Clicking in the center of a larger board with no adjacent mines. This tests the recursive revealing of multiple empty squares.\n\n5. **Board with All Mines**:\n   - Input: `board = [[\"M\", \"M\"], [\"M\", \"M\"]]`, `click = [0, 0]`\n   - Description: A board where all squares are mines. This tests the game-over condition when clicking on a mine.\n\n6. **Board with Mixed Values**:\n   - Input: `board = [[\"E\", \"E\", \"M\"], [\"E\", \"1\", \"E\"], [\"E\", \"E\", \"E\"]]`, `click = [1, 1]`\n   - Description: A board with a mix of empty squares and a mine. Clicking on a square that reveals adjacent mines tests the counting logic.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Board**:\n   - Input: `board = [[\"E\"] * 50 for _ in range(50)]`, `click = [25, 25]`\n   - Description: A maximum size board (50x50) with all empty squares. This tests performance and the ability to handle large inputs.\n\n8. **Corner Click on a Board with Adjacent Mines**:\n   - Input: `board = [[\"M\", \"E\"], [\"E\", \"E\"]]`, `click = [0, 1]`\n   - Description: Clicking on an edge square that has adjacent mines. This tests the correct counting of adjacent mines and the proper reveal of the square.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the Minesweeper implementation."
