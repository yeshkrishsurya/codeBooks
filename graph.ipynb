The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: accounts = [[&quot;John&quot;,&quot;johnsmith@mail.com&quot;,&quot;john_newyork@mail.com&quot;],[&quot;John&quot;,&quot;johnsmith@mail.com&quot;,&quot;john00@mail.com&quot;],[&quot;Mary&quot;,&quot;mary@mail.com&quot;],[&quot;John&quot;,&quot;johnnybravo@mail.com&quot;]]\nOutput: [[&quot;John&quot;,&quot;john00@mail.com&quot;,&quot;john_newyork@mail.com&quot;,&quot;johnsmith@mail.com&quot;],[&quot;Mary&quot;,&quot;mary@mail.com&quot;],[&quot;John&quot;,&quot;johnnybravo@mail.com&quot;]]\nExplanation:\nThe first and second John&#39;s are the same person as they have the common email &quot;johnsmith@mail.com&quot;.\nThe third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.\nWe could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [[&#39;Mary&#39;, &#39;mary@mail.com&#39;], [&#39;John&#39;, &#39;johnnybravo@mail.com&#39;], \n[&#39;John&#39;, &#39;john00@mail.com&#39;, &#39;john_newyork@mail.com&#39;, &#39;johnsmith@mail.com&#39;]] would still be accepted.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: accounts = [[&quot;Gabe&quot;,&quot;Gabe0@m.co&quot;,&quot;Gabe3@m.co&quot;,&quot;Gabe1@m.co&quot;],[&quot;Kevin&quot;,&quot;Kevin3@m.co&quot;,&quot;Kevin5@m.co&quot;,&quot;Kevin0@m.co&quot;],[&quot;Ethan&quot;,&quot;Ethan5@m.co&quot;,&quot;Ethan4@m.co&quot;,&quot;Ethan0@m.co&quot;],[&quot;Hanzo&quot;,&quot;Hanzo3@m.co&quot;,&quot;Hanzo1@m.co&quot;,&quot;Hanzo0@m.co&quot;],[&quot;Fern&quot;,&quot;Fern5@m.co&quot;,&quot;Fern1@m.co&quot;,&quot;Fern0@m.co&quot;]]\nOutput: [[&quot;Ethan&quot;,&quot;Ethan0@m.co&quot;,&quot;Ethan4@m.co&quot;,&quot;Ethan5@m.co&quot;],[&quot;Gabe&quot;,&quot;Gabe0@m.co&quot;,&quot;Gabe1@m.co&quot;,&quot;Gabe3@m.co&quot;],[&quot;Hanzo&quot;,&quot;Hanzo0@m.co&quot;,&quot;Hanzo1@m.co&quot;,&quot;Hanzo3@m.co&quot;],[&quot;Kevin&quot;,&quot;Kevin0@m.co&quot;,&quot;Kevin3@m.co&quot;,&quot;Kevin5@m.co&quot;],[&quot;Fern&quot;,&quot;Fern0@m.co&quot;,&quot;Fern1@m.co&quot;,&quot;Fern5@m.co&quot;]]\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= accounts.length <= 1000\n\t2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10\n\t1 <= accounts[i][j].length <= 30\n\taccounts[i][0] consists of English letters.\n\taccounts[i][j] (for j > 0) is a valid email.\n\n"

Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].\n\nTo perform a flood fill:\n\n\n\tBegin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.\n\tPerform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.\n\tKeep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels&nbsp;and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.\n\tThe process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.\n\n\nReturn the modified image after performing the flood fill.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2\n\nOutput: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n\nFrom the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.\n\nNote the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0\n\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target color. Therefore, no changes are made to the image.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == image.length\n\tn == image[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 50\n\t0 <= image[i][j], color < 216\n\t0 <= sr < m\n\t0 <= sc < n\n\n"

The expected output should be `0` since the lock is already open.\n\n2. **Immediate Deadend**:\n   - **Input**: `deadends = [\"0001\"]`, `target = \"0002\"`\n   - **Description**: This case checks if the algorithm can find a solution when the first move leads to a dead end. The expected output should be `2` (from \"0000\" to \"0002\" via \"0001\").\n\n3. **Multiple Paths to Target**:\n   - **Input**: `deadends = [\"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"1000\"]`, `target = \"0009\"`\n   - **Description**: This case tests the algorithm's ability to find the shortest path when multiple paths exist. The expected output should be `9` (directly turning the last wheel).\n\n4. **All Wheels Locked**:\n   - **Input**: `deadends = [\"0000\", \"1111\", \"2222\", \"3333\", \"4444\", \"5555\", \"6666\", \"7777\", \"8888\", \"9999\"]`, `target = \"0001\"`\n   - **Description**: This case tests the situation where all possible combinations are dead ends except for the target.

The expected output should be `10`, as it requires navigating through the dead ends to reach the target.\n\n6. **Target is a Deadend**:\n   - **Input**: `deadends = [\"9999\"]`, `target = \"9999\"`\n   - **Description**: This case checks"

An empty graph is considered bipartite since there are no edges to violate the bipartite condition.\n\n2. **Single Node Graph**:\n   - **Input**: `graph = [[]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where there is only one node with no edges. A single node graph is trivially bipartite.\n\n3. **Two Connected Nodes**:\n   - **Input**: `graph = [[1], [0]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest bipartite graph with two connected nodes. The output should be `true`.\n\n4. **Two Nodes with a Self-Edge (Invalid Case)**:\n   - **Input**: `graph = [[1], [1]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where there is an invalid self-edge. This should not occur per the problem constraints, but it's important to ensure the implementation correctly handles unexpected input.\n\n5. **Three Nodes Forming a Triangle**:\n   - **Input**: `graph = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a non-bipartite graph where three nodes are fully connected to each other. The output should be `false`.\n\n6. **Disconnected Bipartite Graph**:\n   - **Input**: `graph = [[1, 3], [0, 2], [1, 3], [0, 2]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a bipartite graph that is disconnected. The output should be `true` as both components are bipartite.\n\n7. **Large Bipartite Graph**:\n   - **Input**: `graph = [[1, 2], [0, 3], [0, 3], [1, 2]]` (with 100 nodes)\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and correctness of the solution with the maximum constraint of 100 nodes, ensuring it handles large inputs efficiently.\n\n8. **Complex Non-Bipartite Graph**:\n   - **Input**: `graph = [[1, 2], [0, 3], [0, 3], [1, 2, 4], [3]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a more complex non-bipartite graph with multiple connections.

Each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (rowi, coli). The brick on that location&nbsp;(if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).\n\nReturn an array result, where each result[i] is the number of bricks that will fall after the ith erasure is applied.\n\nNote that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]], hits = [[1,0]]\nOutput: [2]\nExplanation: Starting with the grid:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [1,1,1,0]]\nWe erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [0,1,1,0]]\nThe two underlined bricks are no longer stable as they are no longer connected to the top nor adjacent to another stable brick, so they will fall. The resulting grid is:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0]]\nHence the result is [2].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]], hits = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [0,0]\nExplanation: Starting with the grid:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [1,1,0,0]]\nWe erase the underlined brick at (1,1), resulting in the grid:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [1,0,0,0]]\nAll remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall. The grid remains the same:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [1,0,0,0]]\nNext, we erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0]]\nOnce again, all remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall.\nHence the result is [0,0].\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == grid.length\n\tn == grid[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 200\n\tgrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n\t1 <= hits.length <= 4 * 104\n\thits[i].length == 2\n\t0 <= xi&nbsp;<= m - 1\n\t0 <=&nbsp;yi <= n - 1\n\tAll (xi, yi) are unique.\n\n"

This checks how the function handles the absence of bricks and ensures it does not throw an error.\n\n2. **Single Brick**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1]], hits = [[0, 0]]`\n   - **Description**: A grid with a single brick that will be hit. This tests the basic functionality of erasing a brick and checking if it falls correctly.\n\n3. **Single Row with Multiple Bricks**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1, 1, 1]], hits = [[0, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: A single row with multiple bricks. Hitting the middle brick should cause the bricks on either side to remain stable, testing the stability logic.\n\n4. **Single Column with Multiple Bricks**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1], [1], [1]], hits = [[1, 0]]`\n   - **Description**: A single column with multiple bricks. Hitting the middle brick should cause the bricks above and below to remain stable, testing vertical stability.\n\n5. **All Bricks Connected**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1, 1], [1, 1]], hits = [[1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n   - **Description**: A fully connected grid of bricks. Hitting the bottom right brick should cause the top left brick to remain stable, testing cascading effects of hits.\n\n6. **Bricks with Gaps**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1]], hits = [[0, 0], [1, 2]]`\n   - **Description**: A grid with gaps between bricks. This tests the logic of stability when some bricks are not directly connected.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Grid**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1]*200 for _ in range(200)], hits = [[i, j] for i in range(200) for j in range(200)]`\n   - **Description**: A grid at the maximum size (200x200) with all bricks present. This tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm under maximum constraints.\n\n8. **Sequential Hits on Stable Bricks**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]], hits = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]]`\n   - **Description**: Sequentially hitting all bricks in a"

The expected output should be 1, as a single \"A\" instruction will reach the target.\n\n2. **Target is a Power of Two**:\n   - **Input**: `target = 8`\n   - **Description**: Since 8 is a power of two, it can be reached directly by accelerating. This tests if the algorithm can efficiently recognize and utilize powers of two. The expected output should be 4 (\"AAAA\").\n\n3. **Target Just Beyond a Power of Two**:\n   - **Input**: `target = 9`\n   - **Description**: This case checks how the algorithm handles targets that are just beyond a power of two. The expected output should be 5 (\"AAARA\"), as it requires reversing to reach the target after overshooting.\n\n4. **Target Requires Multiple Reverses**:\n   - **Input**: `target = 7`\n   - **Description**: This case checks if the algorithm can handle situations where reversing is necessary to reach the target after overshooting. The expected output should be 5 (\"AAARA\").\n\n5. **Large Target Value**:\n   - **Input**: `target = 10000`\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm with the maximum constraint. It checks whether the algorithm can compute the result in a reasonable time frame.\n\n6. **Target is Odd**:\n   - **Input**: `target = 5`\n   - **Description**: This case examines how the algorithm deals with odd targets, which may require more complex sequences of instructions. The expected output should be 5 (\"AAARA\").\n\n7. **Target is Even, Not a Power of Two**:\n   - **Input**: `target = 10`\n   - **Description**: This case tests how the algorithm handles even targets that are not powers of two. The expected output should be 6 (\"AAARAA\").\n\n8. **Target is Negative**:\n   - **Input**: `target = -1`\n   - **Description**: Although the problem states that the target will be a positive integer, testing negative values can help ensure that the algorithm correctly handles unexpected inputs. This case may not have a defined output based on the problem constraints, but it can be useful for robustness testing.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive test suite for the problem."

        "Two strings, X and Y, are considered similar if either they are identical or we can make them equivalent by swapping at most two letters (in distinct positions) within the string X.\n\nFor example, &quot;tars&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;rats&quot;&nbsp;are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and &quot;rats&quot; and &quot;arts&quot; are similar, but &quot;star&quot; is not similar to &quot;tars&quot;, &quot;rats&quot;, or &quot;arts&quot;.\n\nTogether, these form two connected groups by similarity: {&quot;tars&quot;, &quot;rats&quot;, &quot;arts&quot;} and {&quot;star&quot;}.&nbsp; Notice that &quot;tars&quot; and &quot;arts&quot; are in the same group even though they are not similar.&nbsp; Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.\n\nWe are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: strs = [&quot;tars&quot;,&quot;rats&quot;,&quot;arts&quot;,&quot;star&quot;]\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: strs = [&quot;omv&quot;,&quot;ovm&quot;]\nOutput: 1\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= strs.length <= 300\n\t1 <= strs[i].length <= 300\n\tstrs[i] consists of lowercase letters only.\n\tAll words in strs have the same length and are anagrams of each other.\n\n"

The expected output should be `1` since they are all identical and thus form one group.\n\n4. **Two Strings, Not Similar**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"abc\", \"def\"]`\n   - **Description**: Test with two strings that are not similar. The expected output should be `2` since each string forms its own group.\n\n5. **Two Strings, Similar**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"abc\", \"acb\"]`\n   - **Description**: Test with two strings that can be made similar by swapping two letters. The expected output should be `1` since they form one group.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"a\" * 300] * 300`\n   - **Description**: Test with the maximum constraints where all strings are identical and of maximum length. The expected output should be `1`.\n\n7. **Multiple Groups with Similar Connections**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"abc\", \"acb\", \"bac\", \"xyz\", \"zyx\"]`\n   - **Description**: Test with multiple strings where some are similar and others are not. The expected output should be `2` since `[\"abc\", \"acb\", \"bac\"]` form one group and `[\"xyz\", \"zyx\"]` form another.\n\n8. **All Strings Similar Through Multiple Swaps**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"abcd\", \"abdc\", \"acbd\", \"adbc\"]`\n   - **Description**: Test with strings that can be connected through multiple swaps.

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases for the \"Loud and Rich\" problem:\n\n1. **Empty Input**:\n   - **Input**: `richer = []`, `quiet = []`\n   - **Description**: Tests the behavior of the function when no people are present. The expected output should also be an empty array.\n\n2. **Single Person**:\n   - **Input**: `richer = []`, `quiet = [0]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest case with only one person. The output should be `[0]` since the only person is the quietest.\n\n3. **Two People with Direct Relationship**:\n   - **Input**: `richer = [[1, 0]]`, `quiet = [1, 0]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a direct relationship where one person is richer than the other. The expected output should be `[1, 1]` since person 0 is richer but person 1 is quieter.\n\n4. **Multiple People with No Rich Relationships**:\n   - **Input**: `richer = []`, `quiet = [3, 2, 5, 4]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where there are multiple people but no richer relationships. Each person should point to themselves, resulting in `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.\n\n5. **Chain of Richness**:\n   - **Input**: `richer = [[1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2]]`, `quiet = [3, 2, 1, 0]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a linear chain of richness. The expected output should be `[3, 3, 3, 3]` since person 3 is the quietest among all.\n\n6. **Complex Relationships with Multiple Quiet People**:\n   - **Input**: `richer = [[1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 3]]`, `quiet = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a more complex relationship with multiple people having different quietness levels. The expected output should be `[3, 3, 3, 3, 4]`.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `richer = [[i, j] for i in range(500) for j in range(i)]`, `quiet = [i for i in range(500)]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the constraints with 500 people.

This tests the handling of the simplest case.\n\n2. **Single Key and Lock with Direct Path**:\n   - Input: `grid = [\"@.a\", \"#.A\"]`\n   - Description: A straightforward case where there is a direct path to the key and back to the lock. This checks if the algorithm can find the shortest path efficiently.\n\n3. **Single Key and Lock with a Wall**:\n   - Input: `grid = [\"@#a\", \"#.A\"]`\n   - Description: A scenario where a wall blocks the direct path between the key and the lock. This tests the algorithm's ability to navigate around obstacles.\n\n4. **Multiple Keys and Locks with Complex Paths**:\n   - Input: `grid = [\"@.a..\", \"###.#\", \"b.A.B\"]`\n   - Description: A more complex grid with multiple keys and locks, requiring the algorithm to find the optimal path to collect all keys. This tests the algorithm's efficiency and correctness in a more complicated scenario.\n\n5. **All Keys Accessible Without Locks**:\n   - Input: `grid = [\"@..a\", \"..b.\", \"c...\"]`\n   - Description: A grid where all keys can be collected without encountering any locks. This tests if the algorithm can correctly identify that all keys can be collected without restrictions.\n\n6. **Keys Surrounded by Locks**:\n   - Input: `grid = [\"@A\", \"b#\"]`\n   - Description: A case where the key is surrounded by locks and cannot be accessed. This tests if the algorithm correctly identifies impossible scenarios and returns -1.\n\n7. **Maximum Grid Size with All Keys**:\n   - Input: A 30x30 grid filled with walls except for a starting point and a path to collect all keys (e.g., `grid = [\"@\"+ \".\"*28 + \".\"] + [\"#\"*30]*28 + [\".\"*30]`)\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the algorithm when handling the maximum grid size and ensuring it can still compute the shortest path efficiently.\n\n8. **Keys and Locks in a Loop**:\n   - Input: `grid = [\"@.a\", \"A..\", \"b..\", \".B.\"]`\n   - Description: A scenario where keys and locks are arranged in a loop, requiring the algorithm to navigate back and forth. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle paths that require revisiting locations.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive test of the solution's robustness."

The expected output should be 0 since there are no nodes to reach.\n\n2. **Single Node**:\n   - **Input**: `edges = [], maxMoves = 5, n = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with a single node and no edges.

The expected output should be 10002 (1 original node + 10000 new nodes + 1 connected node).\n\n7. **Multiple Edges with Zero Subdivisions**:\n   - **Input**: `edges = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0]], maxMoves = 1, n = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where edges exist but have no subdivisions.

This tests the basic functionality of the algorithm.\n\n2. **Single Row with Islands**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 0, 1]]`\n   - Description: A single row with two islands separated by water. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle horizontal connections.\n\n3. **Single Column with Islands**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1], [0], [1]]`\n   - Description: A single column with two islands separated by water. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle vertical connections.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Grid**:\n   - Input: A 100x100 grid where two islands are located at opposite corners, e.g., `grid = [[1]*100] + [[0]*100]*98 + [[0]*100 + [1]]`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the largest input size allowed by the constraints.\n\n5. **Islands Surrounded by Water**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n   - Description: Two islands separated by a row of water.

Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].\n2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].\n3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].\n4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].\n5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].\nStone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:\n1.

The expected output should be 2, as both elements form a connected component.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `nums = [i for i in range(1, 20001)]`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum allowed size of the input array.

Can we assume that the input paths will always adhere to the constraints (e.g., no duplicate paths, valid garden indices) or should we implement checks to handle potential invalid input?"

The output should be `[1]`, as there are no adjacent gardens to consider.\n\n2. **Two Gardens with One Path**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 2`, `paths = [[1, 2]]`\n   - **Description**: This case checks the simplest scenario with two gardens connected by a single path. The expected output could be `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`.\n\n3. **Three Gardens in a Line**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 3`, `paths = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]`\n   - **Description**: This tests a linear connection of gardens. The output should be `[1, 2, 1]` or any valid combination where adjacent gardens have different flowers.\n\n4. **Three Gardens with a Cycle**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 3`, `paths = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: This tests a complete cycle among three gardens. The output could be `[1, 2, 3]`, `[1, 3, 2]`, etc., ensuring that all adjacent gardens have different flowers.\n\n5. **Multiple Disconnected Components**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5`, `paths = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`\n   - **Description**: This case checks for multiple disconnected components in the graph. The output could be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` or any valid combination for the two components.\n\n6. **Maximum Gardens with No Paths**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 10^4`, `paths = []`\n   - **Description**: This tests the upper limit of gardens with no paths. The output should be a valid array of size `10^4`, such as `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`.\n\n7. **Maximum Gardens with Maximum Paths**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 10^4`, `paths = [[i, i+1] for i in range(1, 10^4)]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the upper limit of gardens with the maximum number of paths in a linear configuration. The output should alternate flower types, e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 2, ..., 1]`.\n\n8. **Complex Graph with All Gardens Connected**:"

The player can move up, down, left, right in grid if it is a floor (empty cell).\n\tThe character &#39;.&#39; represents the floor which means a free cell to walk.\n\tThe character&nbsp;&#39;#&#39;&nbsp;represents the wall which means an obstacle (impossible to walk there).\n\tThere is only one box &#39;B&#39; and one target cell &#39;T&#39; in the grid.\n\tThe box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box.

The output should be `1` since you can only start at index 0 and cannot jump anywhere.\n\n5. **Array with Peaks and Valleys**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6], d = 2`\n   - Description: A case with alternating peaks and valleys. The output should be calculated based on valid jumps, testing the logic of the algorithm.\n\n6. **Large `d` with Sparse Decreasing Values**:\n   - Input: `arr = [10, 1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5], d = 5`\n   - Description: A case where `d` is large enough to potentially jump over several indices, but the values do not allow for many valid jumps. The output should reflect the maximum reachable indices.\n\n7. **Array with Duplicates and a Large `d`**:\n   - Input: `arr = [5, 1, 5, 1, 5], d = 2`\n   - Description: Tests how the algorithm handles duplicates and whether it can jump correctly. The output should be `3` since you can jump from index 0 to index 2 and then to index 4.\n\n8. **Edge Case with Maximum Value of `arr[i]`**:\n   - Input: `arr = [100000, 99999, 99998, 99997], d = 3`\n   - Description: Tests the algorithm's ability to handle maximum values. The output should be `4` since you can jump from the first index to the last.\n\nThese edge cases cover"

In case the frog can jump to several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. Otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex, it jumps forever on the same vertex.\n\nThe edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi.\n\nReturn the probability that after t seconds the frog is on the vertex target. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 2, target = 4\nOutput: 0.16666666666666666 \nExplanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666. \n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 1, target = 7\nOutput: 0.3333333333333333\nExplanation: The figure above shows the given graph.

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid\" problem:\n\n1. **Minimum Size Grid (1x1)**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1]]`\n   - Description: The smallest possible grid with only one cell. This tests if the function can handle the simplest case where the start and end are the same.\n\n2. **Single Row Grid (1xn)**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1]]`\n   - Description: A single row grid where all cells are connected horizontally. This tests if the function can traverse a linear path.\n\n3. **Single Column Grid (mx1)**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[2], [2], [2]]`\n   - Description: A single column grid where all cells are connected vertically. This tests if the function can handle vertical traversal.\n\n4. **Blocked Path**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]`\n   - Description: A grid where the path is blocked by cells that do not connect properly. This tests if the function correctly identifies when no valid path exists.\n\n5. **Complex Path with Loops**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6], [3, 2, 1]]`\n   - Description: A grid that has multiple paths and loops. This tests if the function can find a valid path among multiple options.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Grid (300x300)**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1]*300 for _ in range(300)]`\n   - Description: A grid at the maximum size with all cells connected horizontally. This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution with a large input.\n\n7. **Disconnected Sections**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`\n   - Description: A grid where certain sections are completely disconnected from others. This tests if the function can identify when the start and end are unreachable.\n\n8. **Path with Dead Ends**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 6]]`\n   - Description: A grid where some paths lead to dead ends.

This tests if the function can handle the minimum constraints and correctly identifies that no roads need to be changed.\n\n2. **All Roads Pointing Away from City Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5, connections = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]`\n   - **Description**: A linear configuration where all roads lead away from city 0. This case checks if the function can correctly identify that all roads need to be reversed.\n\n3. **Star Configuration**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5, connections = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]]`\n   - **Description**: A star configuration where city 0 is the center. This tests if the function recognizes that no roads need to be changed since all cities can directly reach city 0.\n\n4. **Multiple Paths to City Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 6, connections = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [0, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]`\n   - **Description**: A configuration with multiple paths leading to city 0. This tests the function's ability to handle complex trees and ensure it finds the minimum number of changes.\n\n5. **Disconnected Graph (Invalid Case)**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 4, connections = [[0, 1], [2, 3]]`\n   - **Description**: Although the problem guarantees a connected tree, this case tests how the function handles an invalid input where not all cities can reach city 0. The expected behavior should be to either raise an error or handle it gracefully.\n\n6. **Maximum Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 50000, connections = [[i, i + 1] for i in range(49999)]`\n   - **Description**: A large input case with a linear configuration of 50,000 cities. This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution under maximum constraints.\n\n7. **Cyclic Configuration**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 4, connections = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 0]]`\n   - **Description**: A cyclic configuration which is not a tree.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph&#39;s edges that connects all vertices without cycles&nbsp;and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n\nFind all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph&#39;s minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a&nbsp;critical edge. On&nbsp;the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.\n\nNote that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]\nExplanation: The figure above describes the graph.\nThe following figure shows all the possible MSTs:\n\nNotice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.\nThe edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]\nOutput: [[],[0,1,2,3]]\nExplanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= n <= 100\n\t1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)\n\tedges[i].length == 3\n\t0 <= ai < bi < n\n\t1 <= weighti&nbsp;<= 1000\n\tAll pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.\n\n"

The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.\n\nReturn the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return -1 if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\n\nInput: n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: In the current graph, Alice cannot reach node 4 from the other nodes. Likewise, Bob cannot reach 1. Therefore it&#39;s impossible to make the graph fully traversable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t1 <= edges.length <= min(105, 3 * n * (n - 1) / 2)\n\tedges[i].length == 3\n\t1 <= typei <= 3\n\t1 <= ui < vi <= n\n\tAll tuples (typei, ui, vi) are distinct.\n\n"

The expected output should be `1`, as each node can only count itself.\n\n4. **Cycle with Multiple Nodes**:\n   - Input: `colors = \"abc\"`, `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]`\n   - Description: Tests a cycle involving multiple nodes.

You must use all the tickets once and only once.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: tickets = [[&quot;MUC&quot;,&quot;LHR&quot;],[&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;MUC&quot;],[&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;SJC&quot;],[&quot;LHR&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;]]\nOutput: [&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;MUC&quot;,&quot;LHR&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;SJC&quot;]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: tickets = [[&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;],[&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;],[&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;],[&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;],[&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;]]\nOutput: [&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;]\nExplanation: Another possible reconstruction is [&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;] but it is larger in lexical order.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= tickets.length <= 300\n\ttickets[i].length == 2\n\tfromi.length == 3\n\ttoi.length == 3\n\tfromi and toi consist of uppercase English letters.\n\tfromi != toi\n\n"
