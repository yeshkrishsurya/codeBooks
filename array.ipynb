For example, if we encounter `1`, we should try to place it at index `0` (i.e., `nums[0]`), `2` at index `1`, and so on. This means that for each number `x` in the array, we should place it at index `x - 1` if `1 <= x <= n`.\n",

        "     - If the current element is greater than the previous one, it is part of an increasing sequence. Increment `current_length`.\n",

This checks if the function can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n7. **All 1-bit Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `bits = [0] * 1000`\n   - **Description**: An edge case where all characters are 1-bit characters (except the last 0).

Booking an event in an empty calendar should return `true`.\n\n2. **Single Event Booking**:\n   - **Input**: `book(5, 10)`\n   - **Description**: After booking the first event, attempt to book a non-overlapping event. This should return `true`, confirming that the calendar can handle multiple non-overlapping events.\n\n3. **Adjacent Events**:\n   - **Input**: `book(10, 15)`\n   - **Description**: Test booking an event that starts exactly when the previous event ends. This should return `true`, as there is no overlap.\n\n4. **Overlapping Events**:\n   - **Input**: `book(12, 18)`\n   - **Description**: Attempt to book an event that overlaps with an existing event. This should return `false`, confirming that the calendar correctly identifies double bookings.\n\n5. **Exact End and Start Time**:\n   - **Input**: `book(15, 20)`\n   - **Description**: Test booking an event that starts exactly when another event ends. This should return `true`, showing that the calendar can handle edge cases where events touch but do not overlap.\n\n6. **Multiple Events with Interleaving Times**:\n   - **Input**: `book(8, 12)`, `book(6, 9)`, `book(11, 13)`\n   - **Description**: Test a sequence of bookings where some events overlap and some do not. The expected results should be `true` for the first two bookings and `false` for the third, demonstrating the calendar's ability to manage complex scenarios.\n\n7. **Maximum Boundaries**:\n   - **Input**: `book(0, 1000000000)`\n   - **Description**: Test booking an event that spans the maximum possible range. This should return `true`, ensuring that the implementation can handle large values without overflow or performance issues.\n\n8. **Repeated Bookings**:\n   - **Input**: `book(5, 10)`, `book(5, 10)`\n   - **Description**: Attempt to book the same event twice. The first call should return `true`, while the second should return `false`, confirming that the calendar does not allow duplicate bookings.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including initial conditions, overlapping and adjacent events, maximum constraints, and duplicate bookings, ensuring a comprehensive test of the calendar's functionality."

Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.\n\n\n\tFor example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].\n\n\nReturn the rotation index k that corresponds to the highest score we can achieve if we rotated nums by it. If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index k.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: nums = [2,3,1,4,0]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Scores for each k are listed below: \nk = 0,  nums = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2\nk = 1,  nums = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3\nk = 2,  nums = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3\nk = 3,  nums = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4\nk = 4,  nums = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3\nSo we should choose k = 3, which has the highest score.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,0,2,4]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: nums will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.\nSo we will choose the smallest k, which is 0.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t0 <= nums[i] < nums.length\n\n"

This tests if the function can handle the smallest input size.\n\n2. **All Elements Equal**:\n   - Input: `nums = [3, 3, 3, 3]`\n   - Description: All elements are the same. This checks if the function correctly identifies that all rotations yield the same score and returns the smallest index.\n\n3. **Sorted Array**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`\n   - Description: A sorted array where every element is less than or equal to its index. This tests if the function can handle cases where the maximum score is achieved at the initial position.\n\n4. **Reverse Sorted Array**:\n   - Input: `nums = [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`\n   - Description: A reverse sorted array where no elements are less than or equal to their index. This checks if the function can handle cases where the maximum score is achieved at the last position.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Array with Sequential Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 1, 2, ..., 99999]` (length = 100000)\n   - Description: Tests performance and efficiency with the maximum allowed input size. This ensures that the algorithm can handle large inputs within time limits.\n\n6. **Array with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`\n   - Description: An array containing duplicate values. This tests if the function correctly calculates the score considering duplicates and returns the smallest index with the highest score.\n\n7. **Array with Maximum Value**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n   - Description: A larger array with sequential values. This checks if the function can handle a typical case with a straightforward scoring mechanism.\n\n8. **Array with Random Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]`\n   - Description: A randomly ordered array. This tests the algorithm's ability to compute scores in a non-trivial arrangement and find the optimal rotation index.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations that are crucial for ensuring the robustness of the solution."

The output should be `0.00000` since the top glass remains empty.\n\n2. **Test Case 2: Single Glass Overflow**\n   - **Input:** `poured = 1, query_row = 0, query_glass = 0`\n   - **Description:** Test with just enough champagne to fill the top glass. The output should be `1.00000`.\n\n3. **Test Case 3: Exact Overflow to Next Row**\n   - **Input:** `poured = 2, query_row = 1, query_glass = 0`\n   - **Description:** Test with exactly 2 cups poured. The top glass fills and overflows equally to the two glasses below. The output should be `1.00000` for the first glass in the second row.\n\n4. **Test Case 4: Excess Champagne Distributed**\n   - **Input:** `poured = 3, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1`\n   - **Description:** Test with 3 cups poured. The top glass fills and overflows, resulting in the two glasses below receiving equal amounts. The output should be `0.50000`.\n\n5. **Test Case 5: Large Overflow Case**\n   - **Input:** `poured = 100000009, query_row = 33, query_glass = 17`\n   - **Description:** Test with a very large amount of champagne to check how the algorithm handles large numbers and distributes them across multiple rows. The expected output should be `1.00000`.\n\n6. **Test Case 6: Maximum Row and Glass Index**\n   - **Input:** `poured = 100, query_row = 99, query_glass = 0`\n   - **Description:** Test the maximum row index (99) with a reasonable amount of champagne. This checks if the algorithm can handle the maximum constraints without errors.\n\n7. **Test Case 7: Querying a Glass with No Champagne**\n   - **Input:** `poured = 1, query_row = 2, query_glass = 0`\n   - **Description:** Test a case where the poured champagne is insufficient to fill any glasses in the queried row. The output should be `0.00000`.\n\n8. **Test Case 8: Performance Edge Case**\n   - **Input:** `poured = 1000000000, query_row = 99, query_glass = 50`\n   - **Description:** Test with the maximum possible poured champagne to ensure the algorithm performs efficiently without timing out or running into memory issues.

This tests the basic functionality of overlap detection.\n\n2. **Minimum Size Matrix (1x1) with No Overlap**:\n   - Input: `img1 = [[1]]`, `img2 = [[0]]`\n   - Description: This case checks the scenario where the images are the smallest size but have no overlapping 1s.\n\n3. **Empty Matrix (0x0)**:\n   - Input: `img1 = [[]]`, `img2 = [[]]`\n   - Description: This case tests how the function handles empty matrices. It should return 0 as there are no overlapping bits.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Matrix (30x30) with Full Overlap**:\n   - Input: `img1 = [[1]*30 for _ in range(30)]`, `img2 = [[1]*30 for _ in range(30)]`\n   - Description: Both matrices are filled with 1s.

The output should be the same single element.\n\n3. **Single Row Matrix**:\n   - Input: `matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4]]`\n   - Description: Tests a matrix with a single row and multiple columns. The output should be a single column with the same elements.\n\n4. **Single Column Matrix**:\n   - Input: `matrix = [[1], [2], [3], [4]]`\n   - Description: Tests a matrix with a single column and multiple rows.

The output should be a 1000x1000 matrix with all elements equal to 1.\n\n8. **Matrix with Zero Values**:\n   - Input: `matrix = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n   - Description: Tests a matrix filled with zero values. The output should also be a matrix filled with zeroes, verifying that the function handles zero correctly.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring that the solution is robust and handles various inputs correctly."

This tests the basic functionality of the algorithm.\n\n2. **All Elements Equal**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [2, 2, 2, 2]`\n   - **Description**: All elements are the same. This checks if the algorithm can handle cases where partitioning can occur but the values are identical.\n\n3. **Already Partitioned Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: The array is already in a valid partitioned state.

All columns are trivially sorted, so the output should be `0`.\n\n3. **All Columns Unsorted**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"zyx\", \"wvu\", \"tsr\"]`\n   - **Description**: All columns are in reverse order. The output should be equal to the number of columns, which is `3`.\n\n4. **Mixed Sorted and Unsorted Columns**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"abc\", \"bde\", \"cae\"]`\n   - **Description**: Some columns are sorted while others are not. The output should reflect the number of unsorted columns, which is `1` (column 1).\n\n5. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"a\" * 1000] * 100`\n   - **Description**: A test case with the maximum constraints (100 strings of length 1000). All columns are identical, so the output should be `0`.\n\n6. **Strings with Varying Lengths**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"abc\", \"bde\", \"c\"]`\n   - **Description**: This case tests the handling of strings of varying lengths. The output should be `1` since the last column is shorter and thus unsorted.\n\n7. **Columns with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"abc\", \"aac\", \"bbc\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests how duplicates are handled. The first column is sorted, but the second column is not. The output should be `1`.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case with Random Order**:\n   - **Input**: `[\"xyz\", \"abc\", \"def\", \"ghi\", \"jkl\"]`\n   - **Description**: A larger set of strings that are randomly ordered. This tests the performance of the solution. The output should be `0` since all columns are sorted.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of edge cases, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance scenarios, ensuring a robust evaluation of the solution."

The expected output is `1` since the single element forms a valid subarray.\n\n2. **Single Element Not Divisible by k**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [7], k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests a single element that is not divisible by `k`. The expected output is `0` since there are no valid subarrays.\n\n3. **All Elements Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 0, 0], k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where all elements are zero. Every subarray will have a sum of zero, which is divisible by any `k`. The expected output is `6` (subarrays: [0], [0], [0], [0,0], [0,0], [0,0,0]).\n\n4. **Negative and Positive Numbers**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-1, 1, -1, 1], k = 2`\n   - **Description**: Tests a mix of negative and positive numbers. The expected output is `6` (subarrays: [-1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1, -1], [1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, -1, 1], [1]).\n\n5. **Large Array with Maximum Size**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1] * (3 * 10**4), k = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance with the maximum size of the array where all elements are `1` and `k` is `1`. The expected output is the total number of subarrays, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2 = 450000000`.\n\n6. **Array with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [2, 2, 2, 2], k = 2`\n   - **Description**: Tests an array where all elements are the same and equal to `k`.

This tests the basic functionality of the algorithm.\n\n2. **Array with Zeroes**:\n   - Input: `arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - Description: An array consisting entirely of zeroes. This tests if the algorithm can handle cases where all elements are the same and equal to zero.\n\n3. **Negative and Positive Mix**:\n   - Input: `arr = [-1, -1, 2, 2, 2]`\n   - Description: An array with both negative and positive numbers that can be partitioned. This checks if the algorithm correctly identifies valid partitions with mixed signs.\n\n4. **All Negative Numbers**:\n   - Input: `arr = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`\n   - Description: An array with all negative numbers.

This checks if the algorithm correctly identifies when partitioning is impossible.\n\n7. **Maximum Length Array**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1] * 50000` (50,000 elements of 1)\n   - Description: The maximum size of the array with all identical elements. This tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm under upper limit constraints.\n\n8. **Partition with One Element Different**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`\n   - Description: An array where one element is different but can still be partitioned. This tests if the algorithm can find partitions when the sums are equal despite having a different element.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance edge cases, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's correctness and efficiency."

Alice cannot make any move since there are no valid x values (0 < x < 1). This tests the game's behavior when no moves are possible from the start.\n\n2. **Small Even Number (n = 2)**:\n   - Input: `n = 2`\n   - Description: This is the simplest case where Alice can win immediately by choosing x = 1, leaving Bob with no moves. It checks if the function correctly identifies winning conditions for Alice with the smallest even number.\n\n3. **Small Odd Number (n = 3)**:\n   - Input: `n = 3`\n   - Description: Alice can only choose x = 1, leaving Bob with n = 2, which is a winning position for Bob. This tests the function's ability to recognize losing conditions for Alice when starting with an odd number.\n\n4. **Small Even Number Greater Than 2 (n = 4)**:\n   - Input: `n = 4`\n   - Description: Alice can choose x = 1 or x = 2. If she chooses x = 1, Bob will have n = 3 (winning for Bob), but if she chooses x = 2, Bob will have n = 2 (winning for Alice). This tests the decision-making process when multiple optimal moves are available.\n\n5. **Small Odd Number Greater Than 3 (n = 5)**:\n   - Input: `n = 5`\n   - Description: Similar to n = 3, Alice can only choose x = 1, leading to n = 4 for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob. This checks the consistency of the logic for odd numbers.\n\n6. **Maximum Input (n = 1000)**:\n   - Input: `n = 1000`\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the solution with the largest input size allowed by the constraints. It ensures that the function can handle the upper limits efficiently.\n\n7. **Even Number Just Below Maximum (n = 999)**:\n   - Input: `n = 999`\n   - Description: This tests the edge case of an odd number just below the maximum limit. It checks if the function can correctly evaluate the winning and losing positions for large odd numbers.\n\n8. **Even Number Just Above a Small Odd (n = 6)**:\n   - Input: `n = 6`\n   - Description: Alice can choose x = 1, 2, or 3. This tests the function's ability to evaluate multiple paths and determine optimal moves when starting with a small even number that has multiple divisors. \n\nThese test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, performance"

The output should be \"firstsecondthird\".\n\n2. **Reversed Order Test Case**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [3, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the mechanism's ability to enforce the correct order despite the reverse input. The expected output is \"firstsecondthird\".\n\n3. **Interleaved Order Test Case**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 3, 2]`\n   - **Description**: This case checks if the implementation can handle interleaved calls correctly. The output should still be \"firstsecondthird\".\n\n4. **All Same Order Test Case**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [2, 2, 2]` (hypothetical, since nums is a permutation of [1, 2, 3])\n   - **Description**: This tests how the implementation handles invalid input. Since the problem states that nums is a permutation of [1, 2, 3], this case should not occur in practice, but it helps to consider how the system handles invalid inputs.\n\n5. **Empty Input Test Case**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = []` (hypothetical, since nums is a permutation of [1, 2, 3])\n   - **Description**: This tests how the implementation behaves with no input.

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Print FooBar Alternately\" problem:\n\n1. **Minimum Input (n = 1)**:\n   - **Description**: Test the smallest valid input where `n` is 1. This checks the basic functionality of the program.\n   - **Expected Output**: \"foobar\"\n\n2. **Small Input (n = 2)**:\n   - **Description**: Test with a small input where `n` is 2. This verifies that the program can handle basic alternating outputs correctly.\n   - **Expected Output**: \"foobarfoobar\"\n\n3. **Medium Input (n = 5)**:\n   - **Description**: Test with a moderate value of `n` to ensure that the program can handle larger outputs while maintaining the correct order.\n   - **Expected Output**: \"foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobar\"\n\n4. **Maximum Input (n = 1000)**:\n   - **Description**: Test with the maximum constraint of `n` (1000) to evaluate performance and ensure that the program can handle large outputs without issues.\n   - **Expected Output**: A string of \"foobar\" repeated 1000 times.\n\n5. **Thread Safety**:\n   - **Description**: Test the program's behavior when multiple threads are calling `foo()` and `bar()` simultaneously. This checks for race conditions and ensures that the output remains consistent.\n   - **Expected Output**: \"foobar\" repeated `n` times, regardless of the order of thread execution.\n\n6. **Performance Under Load**:\n   - **Description**: Stress test the program by running multiple instances of `FooBar` with different values of `n` in parallel. This evaluates how well the program scales under heavy loads.\n   - **Expected Output**: Each instance should output \"foobar\" `n` times correctly, without mixing outputs from different instances.\n\n7. **Non-Standard Thread Scheduling**:\n   - **Description**: Simulate a scenario where thread scheduling is non-standard (e.g., thread A gets significantly more CPU time than thread B). This tests the robustness of the synchronization mechanism.\n   - **Expected Output**: \"foobar\" repeated `n` times, ensuring that the output remains consistent despite scheduling anomalies.\n\n8. **Immediate Termination**:\n   - **Description**: Test the program's response when one thread is terminated prematurely (e.g., if `foo()` is interrupted before completing its loop). This checks how the program handles unexpected interruptions.\n   - **Expected Output**: The output should still be \"foobar\" repeated `n` times if the other thread completes its execution, or it may result in an incomplete sequence if not handled properly.\n\nThese edge cases help ensure that the implementation is robust, performs well under various conditions, and adheres to the expected output format."

        "There are two kinds of threads: oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules.\n\nThere is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.\n\nIn other words:\n\n\n\tIf an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.\n\tIf a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.\n\n\nWe do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.\n\nWrite synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: water = &quot;HOH&quot;\nOutput: &quot;HHO&quot;\nExplanation: &quot;HOH&quot; and &quot;OHH&quot; are also valid answers.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: water = &quot;OOHHHH&quot;\nOutput: &quot;HHOHHO&quot;\nExplanation: &quot;HOHHHO&quot;, &quot;OHHHHO&quot;, &quot;HHOHOH&quot;, &quot;HOHHOH&quot;, &quot;OHHHOH&quot;, &quot;HHOOHH&quot;, &quot;HOHOHH&quot; and &quot;OHHOHH&quot; are also valid answers.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t3 * n == water.length\n\t1 <= n <= 20\n\twater[i] is either &#39;H&#39; or &#39;O&#39;.\n\tThere will be exactly 2 * n &#39;H&#39; in water.\n\tThere will be exactly n &#39;O&#39; in water.\n\n"

This tests the basic functionality of the synchronization mechanism.\n\n2. **Excess Hydrogen**:\n   - **Input**: `water = \"HHHOOO\"`\n   - **Description**: A case where there are more hydrogen threads than needed to form water molecules. This tests if the implementation can handle excess hydrogen and still wait for the correct number of oxygen threads.\n\n3. **Excess Oxygen**:\n   - **Input**: `water = \"OOHHH\"`\n   - **Description**: A case where there are more oxygen threads than needed. This checks if the implementation can handle excess oxygen and ensure that hydrogen threads are available before proceeding.\n\n4. **All Hydrogen First**:\n   - **Input**: `water = \"HHHOOO\"`\n   - **Description**: All hydrogen threads arrive before any oxygen threads. This tests if the implementation correctly waits for the necessary oxygen threads before forming water.\n\n5. **All Oxygen First**:\n   - **Input**: `water = \"OOHHH\"`\n   - **Description**: All oxygen threads arrive before any hydrogen threads. This tests if the implementation correctly waits for the necessary hydrogen threads before forming water.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `water = \"H\" * 40 + \"O\" * 20` (40 'H' and 20 'O')\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and correctness of the solution with the maximum allowed input size, ensuring that the synchronization mechanism works efficiently under load.\n\n7. **Interleaved Threads**:\n   - **Input**: `water = \"HHOHOHOHOOH\"`\n   - **Description**: A case where hydrogen and oxygen threads are interleaved. This tests if the implementation can handle more complex sequences while still forming valid water molecules.\n\n8. **Invalid Sequence (More Oxygen)**:\n   - **Input**: `water = \"OOOHH\"`\n   - **Description**: An invalid input case where there are more oxygen threads than allowed by the constraints (not a valid input as per problem statement but useful for robustness testing). This checks if the implementation can handle or reject invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including minimum and maximum inputs, excess threads, and various arrangements of hydrogen and oxygen threads, ensuring the solution is robust and performs well under different conditions."

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Decrease Elements To Make Array Zigzag\" problem:\n\n1. **Single Element Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5]`\n   - **Description**: The simplest case where the array has only one element. The output should be `0` since a single element is trivially a zigzag.\n\n2. **Two Element Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2]`\n   - **Description**: An array with two elements. This tests the basic functionality of the zigzag condition. The output should be `0` because it can be considered zigzag (either increasing or decreasing).\n\n3. **Already Zigzag Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]`\n   - **Description**: An array that is already in zigzag form. The output should be `0` since no moves are needed.\n\n4. **All Elements the Same**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [7, 7, 7, 7]`\n   - **Description**: An array where all elements are identical. This tests how the algorithm handles duplicates. The output should be `6` (decreasing three of the elements to create a zigzag).\n\n5. **Maximum Size Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1000] * 1000`\n   - **Description**: An array with the maximum allowed size, filled with the maximum value. This tests performance and efficiency. The expected output should be `999000` (decreasing every second element).\n\n6. **Strictly Increasing Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: A strictly increasing array. This tests the algorithm's ability to transform a non-zigzag array. The expected output should be `6` (decreasing elements to create a zigzag).\n\n7. **Strictly Decreasing Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A strictly decreasing array. Similar to the previous case, it tests the algorithm's handling of a non-zigzag structure. The expected output should be `6`.\n\n8. **Alternating High-Low Pattern**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 1000, 1, 1000, 1]`\n   - **Description**: An array with alternating high and low values. This tests how well the algorithm can minimize moves when faced with extreme differences. The expected output should be `1998` (decreasing the 1000s to create a zigzag).\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of"

However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.\n\nEating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.\n\nDesign a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve;&nbsp;i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.\n\n\n\nThe problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe philosophers&#39; ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function&nbsp;void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:\n\n\n\tphilosopher&nbsp;is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.\n\tpickLeftFork&nbsp;and&nbsp;pickRightFork&nbsp;are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.\n\teat&nbsp;is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked&nbsp;both forks.\n\tputLeftFork&nbsp;and&nbsp;putRightFork&nbsp;are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.\n\tThe philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).\n\n\nFive threads, each representing a philosopher, will&nbsp;simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]\nExplanation:\nn is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.\nThe output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:\noutput[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)\n- a is the id of a philosopher.\n- b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.\n- c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 60\n\n"

Is there a limit to the number of times a philosopher can attempt to eat in a row, or can they continuously call the function?\n\n4. **Philosopher Behavior**: Should we assume that philosophers will always alternate between thinking and eating, or can they remain in one state (thinking or eating) for an arbitrary amount of time?\n\n5. **Output Format**: Can you clarify the expected output format?

This will help assess the performance and ensure that the algorithm can handle a high volume of requests without deadlock or starvation.\n\n3. **All Philosophers Eating Simultaneously**:\n   - Input: Simulate a situation where all philosophers attempt to eat at the same time.\n   - Description: This will test the concurrency control mechanism to ensure that no two philosophers can pick the same fork at the same time, preventing deadlocks.\n\n4. **Alternating Eating Pattern**:\n   - Input: Philosophers alternate their eating requests in a round-robin fashion.\n   - Description: This will help verify if the implementation allows for a fair distribution of eating opportunities among philosophers, ensuring that no philosopher is starved.\n\n5. **Forks Availability**:\n   - Input: Test with scenarios where forks are picked and put down in various orders.\n   - Description: This will help ensure that the implementation correctly handles the state of forks and allows philosophers to pick them up only when they are available.\n\n6. **Long Wait Times**:\n   - Input: Simulate a scenario where philosophers have long wait times before they can eat.\n   - Description: This will help test if the implementation can handle situations where philosophers may be waiting for an extended period without leading to starvation.\n\n7. **Randomized Eating Requests**:\n   - Input: Generate a series of random requests for philosophers to eat, including various patterns of picking and putting down forks.\n   - Description: This will test the robustness of the algorithm against unpredictable behavior and ensure it can handle a variety of scenarios without deadlock.\n\n8. **Repeated Fork Usage**:\n   - Input: Test the case where a philosopher repeatedly picks up and puts down the same fork multiple times in quick succession.\n   - Description: This will help verify that the implementation can handle rapid state changes of forks and ensure that the synchronization mechanism is effective.\n\nThese edge cases will help ensure that the solution is robust, efficient, and free from deadlocks or starvation issues."

This should ideally return an error or an empty result since there are no elements to XOR.\n\n2. **Single Element Array**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [5]`, `queries = [[0, 0]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the array contains only one element.

This tests the lower boundary condition.\n\n2. **Already Optimal Array**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`\n   - Description: An array that is already in increasing order. Reversing any subarray should not increase the value, testing if the solution can identify optimal cases without unnecessary operations.\n\n3. **All Elements Identical**:\n   - Input: `nums = [5, 5, 5, 5]`\n   - Description: An array where all elements are the same. The expected output should be 0 since reversing any subarray will not change the value.\n\n4. **Single Peak**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 3, 2, 4]`\n   - Description: An array with a single peak. This tests the algorithm's ability to identify the best subarray to reverse to maximize the value.\n\n5. **Negative and Positive Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [-1, -3, 2, 4, -2]`\n   - Description: An array that includes both negative and positive numbers. This tests how well the algorithm handles mixed sign values.\n\n6. **Large Array with Alternating Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 100000, 1, 100000, 1, 100000]` (length = 6)\n   - Description: A larger array with alternating small and large values. This tests the performance and correctness of the algorithm with larger differences in values.\n\n7. **Array with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - Description: An array that contains duplicates. This tests if the algorithm can handle cases where reversing subarrays may not lead to distinct values.\n\n8. **Maximum Size Array**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1] * 30000` (an array of 30,000 elements, all set to 1)\n   - Description: Tests the algorithm's performance and efficiency when handling the maximum allowed size of the input array.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution's robustness."

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the problem \"Number of Times Binary String Is Prefix-Aligned\":\n\n1. **Minimum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `flips = [1]`\n   - **Description**: The smallest possible input where the binary string has only one bit. This tests the base case of the algorithm.\n\n2. **Already Prefix-Aligned**:\n   - **Input**: `flips = [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n   - **Description**: A sequence where each flip is in increasing order. This will help verify if the algorithm correctly identifies that the string is prefix-aligned after each flip.\n\n3. **Reversed Order**:\n   - **Input**: `flips = [4, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A sequence where flips are in decreasing order. This checks if the algorithm can handle cases where the flips do not lead to immediate prefix alignment.\n\n4. **Random Order with Gaps**:\n   - **Input**: `flips = [3, 1, 4, 2]`\n   - **Description**: A random permutation that does not follow a clear order. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle arbitrary sequences of flips.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `flips = [i for i in range(1, 50001)]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum constraint of `n = 5 * 10^4`. This checks for efficiency and correctness under large input sizes.\n\n6. **All Flips at the End**:\n   - **Input**: `flips = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (for `n = 5`)\n   - **Description**: All flips occur at the end of the string. This tests the algorithm's ability to recognize that prefix alignment will only occur after all flips are done.\n\n7. **Interleaved Flips**:\n   - **Input**: `flips = [2, 1, 4, 3]`\n   - **Description**: A sequence where flips are interleaved. This tests the algorithm's ability to track the state of the binary string accurately through non-sequential flips.\n\n8. **Single Flip**:\n   - **Input**: `flips = [3]` (for `n = 3`)\n   - **Description**: A case where only one flip is made in a string of length greater than one. This checks if the algorithm correctly identifies that the string is not prefix-aligned after a single flip.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases, performance limits, and special conditions that could affect the correctness of the solution."

The expected output should be an empty list.\n\n2. **Single Element Matrix**:\n   - Input: `matrix = [[5]]`\n   - Description: Test the simplest case with a 1x1 matrix. The single element should be considered both the minimum in its row and maximum in its column, so the expected output is `[5]`.\n\n3. **Single Row Matrix**:\n   - Input: `matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]`\n   - Description: Test a matrix with only one row. The minimum element in the row should be the only candidate for a lucky number, and it should also be the maximum in its column (which only contains itself). Expected output: `[1]`.\n\n4. **Single Column Matrix**:\n   - Input: `matrix = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]`\n   - Description: Similar to the single row case, but with a single column. The minimum element in the column should be the only candidate for a lucky number. Expected output: `[1]`.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Matrix**:\n   - Input: `matrix = [[i + j * 50 for i in range(50)] for j in range(50)]`\n   - Description: Test the performance and correctness of the solution with the maximum allowed size of the matrix (50x50).

In this case, there should be no lucky numbers, as no element can be the minimum in its row and maximum in its column.

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array\" problem:\n\n1. **Minimum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: The smallest valid array with two elements. This tests the function's ability to handle the minimum input size and should return `(1-1)*(1-1) = 0`.\n\n2. **All Elements are the Same**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5, 5, 5, 5]`\n   - **Description**: An array where all elements are identical. This checks if the function can handle duplicates correctly and should return `(5-1)*(5-1) = 16`.\n\n3. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1000] * 500`\n   - **Description**: An array with the maximum allowed size (500 elements), all set to the maximum value (1000). This tests performance and ensures that the function can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n4. **Mixed Values with Zeros**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`\n   - **Description**: An array containing zero and positive integers. This tests how the function handles zero, which should not contribute positively to the product. The expected output is `(4-1)*(3-1) = 6`.\n\n5. **Negative Values (Invalid Case)**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4]`\n   - **Description**: Although the problem constraints specify positive integers, testing with negative numbers can help ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid inputs and handles them appropriately (if applicable).\n\n6. **Large Range of Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 1000, 500, 250]`\n   - **Description**: An array with a wide range of values. This tests if the function can correctly identify the maximum product from diverse inputs. The expected output is `(1000-1)*(500-1) = 499500`.\n\n7. **Consecutive Integers**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: An array of consecutive integers. This tests the function's ability to compute the maximum product from a simple, predictable pattern. The expected output is `(4-1)*(5-1) = 12`.\n\n8. **Two Largest Values at the End**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1000, 999]`\n   - **Description**: An array where the two largest values are at the end.

This will help verify if the algorithm can handle minimal input sizes correctly.\n\n2. **All Elements Same**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [3, 3, 3, 3]`\n   - **Description**: This case checks how the algorithm handles a scenario where all elements are the same. It should ideally require only one operation to increment the entire array at once.\n\n3. **Increasing Sequence**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: This case tests the algorithm's ability to handle a strictly increasing sequence. The expected output should be the number of increments needed to reach each value progressively.\n\n4. **Decreasing Sequence**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: Similar to the increasing sequence, this case tests the algorithm's handling of a strictly decreasing sequence. It should also require a specific number of operations to reach the target.\n\n5. **Large Size with Maximum Values**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [100000] * 100000`\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum constraints. It checks if the algorithm can handle large input sizes efficiently without timing out or running into memory issues.\n\n6. **Alternating Values**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`\n   - **Description**: This case tests how well the algorithm can handle a pattern of alternating values. It should require multiple operations to increment the subarrays appropriately.\n\n7. **Large Gaps**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [1, 0, 0, 5]`\n   - **Description**: This case checks how the algorithm deals with large gaps between values, where most elements are zero and only a few are significantly larger. It should ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies the necessary increments.\n\n8. **Random Values with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `target = [2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: This case tests the algorithm's ability to handle duplicates and non-uniform distributions of values. It should ensure that the algorithm can still calculate the minimum operations correctly despite the presence of duplicates.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, performance considerations, and special patterns in the input data"

The expected output should be `1` since it is the first positive integer missing.\n\n2. **Single Element Array**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [1], k = 1`\n   - **Description**: Test with an array containing a single element. The expected output should be `2`, as it is the first missing positive integer.\n\n3. **Maximum Size Array**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, ..., 1000], k = 500`\n   - **Description**: Test with the maximum size of the array filled with all positive integers from `1` to `1000`. The expected output should be `1500`, as there are no missing numbers in the range.\n\n4. **All Elements Missing**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [100, 101, 102], k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Test with an array where all elements are greater than `5`.

The expected output should be `0`, as no subarray can have a positive product.\n\n5. **Array with Mixed Signs and Zeros**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, -1, 2, -3, 0, 4]`\n   - Description: An array with both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros. The expected output should be `3`, corresponding to the subarray `[2, -3, 0]` or `[4]`.\n\n6. **Long Array with Alternating Signs**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1]`\n   - Description: An edge case with a long array of alternating positive and negative numbers. The expected output should be `1`, as the longest subarrays with positive products are the individual `1`s.\n\n7. **Array with Multiple Negative Numbers**:\n   - Input: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, 4, -5]`\n   - Description: An array containing multiple negative numbers and a positive number. The expected output should be `4`, corresponding to the subarray `[-1, -2, -3, 4]` which has a positive product.\n\n8. **Large Array with Maximum Size**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1] * 100000` (an array of 100,000 ones)\n   - Description: A performance edge case with the maximum allowed size of the array. The expected output should be `100000`, as the product of all elements is positive.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, which are critical for ensuring the robustness of the solution."

The expected output should be `0`.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Matrix with One Special Position**:\n   - Input: `mat = [[0]*100 for _ in range(100)]; mat[50][50] = 1`\n   - Description: A large matrix (100x100) with a single `1` at the center.

For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.\n\n\nYou are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.\n\nReturn a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s).

A ball gets stuck if it hits a &quot;V&quot; shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.\n\nReturn an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the ith column at the top, or -1 if the ball gets stuck in the box.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]\nOutput: [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: This example is shown in the photo.\nBall b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.\nBall b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.\nBall b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.\nBall b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.\nBall b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[-1]]\nOutput: [-1]\nExplanation: The ball gets stuck against the left wall.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]\nOutput: [0,1,2,3,4,-1]\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == grid.length\n\tn == grid[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 100\n\tgrid[i][j] is 1 or -1.\n\n"

Can you clarify how the ball behaves when it reaches the edges of the grid? For instance, if a ball is redirected to the left from the first column or to the right from the last column, should it get stuck or fall out of the grid?\n\n3. What should the output be if all balls get stuck? Should the output array contain only -1s, or should it reflect the specific behavior of each ball?\n\n4. In the case of a \"V\" shaped pattern, can you provide more details on how to identify it? For example, what specific conditions must be met for a ball to get stuck in that scenario?\n\n5.

This tests the simplest case where the ball should fall out of the grid.\n\n2. **Single Column Grid**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1], [-1]]`\n   - Description: A grid with one column and two rows, where the ball should get stuck against the wall. This checks how the algorithm handles vertical constraints.\n\n3. **All Redirecting Right**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]`\n   - Description: A grid where all cells redirect the ball to the right. This tests if the algorithm correctly allows all balls to fall out of the grid.\n\n4. **All Redirecting Left**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]`\n   - Description: A grid where all cells redirect the ball to the left.

This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution under maximum constraints.\n\n7. **Alternating Redirects**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, -1]*50] * 2`\n   - Description: A grid with alternating redirects.

Note that after doing so, there may be more than one ball in some boxes.\n\nReturn an array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the ith box.\n\nEach answer[i] is calculated considering the initial state of the boxes.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: boxes = &quot;110&quot;\nOutput: [1,1,3]\nExplanation: The answer for each box is as follows:\n1) First box: you will have to move one ball from the second box to the first box in one operation.\n2) Second box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the second box in one operation.\n3) Third box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the third box in two operations, and move one ball from the second box to the third box in one operation.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: boxes = &quot;001011&quot;\nOutput: [11,8,5,4,3,4]\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == boxes.length\n\t1 <= n <= 2000\n\tboxes[i] is either &#39;0&#39; or &#39;1&#39;.\n\n"

The expected output should be `[0]` since no operations are needed.\n\n2. **Single Box with One Ball**:\n   - **Input**: `boxes = \"1\"`\n   - **Description**: Similar to the previous case, but with one ball in the box. The expected output should still be `[0]`, as no operations are needed.\n\n3. **All Boxes Empty**:\n   - **Input**: `boxes = \"0000\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a scenario where all boxes are empty. The expected output should be `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, as there are no balls to move.\n\n4. **All Boxes Filled**:\n   - **Input**: `boxes = \"1111\"`\n   - **Description**: All boxes contain one ball. The expected output should be `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, as moving balls to each box will require different numbers of operations.\n\n5. **Alternating Balls**:\n   - **Input**: `boxes = \"101010\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with alternating filled and empty boxes. The expected output should be `[9, 6, 3, 6, 9, 12]`, as the operations needed will vary based on the box index.\n\n6. **Maximum Size with All Balls**:\n   - **Input**: `boxes = \"1\" * 2000` (2000 '1's)\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance edge case with the maximum allowed size of the input where all boxes are filled. The expected output should be a list where the first element is `1998`, the second is `1997`, and so on, down to `0`.\n\n7. **Maximum Size with No Balls**:\n   - **Input**: `boxes = \"0\" * 2000` (2000 '0's)\n   - **Description**: Similar to the previous case but with all boxes empty.

This tests if the function can correctly identify a valid point at the current location.\n\n2. **Single Valid Point**:\n   - Input: `x = 1, y = 2, points = [[1, 3]]`\n   - Description: There is only one valid point that shares the same x-coordinate. This checks if the function can return the index of a single valid point correctly.\n\n3. **Multiple Points with Same Manhattan Distance**:\n   - Input: `x = 2, y = 2, points = [[2, 3], [3, 2], [1, 2]]`\n   - Description: Multiple points are equidistant from the current location. This tests if the function returns the point with the smallest index.\n\n4. **No Valid Points**:\n   - Input: `x = 0, y = 0, points = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]`\n   - Description: All points are located away from the current position.

This tests if the function can correctly identify the nearest point among multiple valid options.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `x = 10000, y = 10000, points = [[i, i] for i in range(1, 10001)]`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the function with the maximum number of points (10,000) to ensure it runs efficiently without exceeding time limits.\n\n7. **Duplicate Points**:\n   - Input: `x = 3, y = 3, points = [[3, 3], [3, 3], [4, 4]]`\n   - Description: Tests how the function handles duplicate points that are valid. It should return the index of the first occurrence.\n\n8. **Points with Maximum Coordinate Values**:\n   - Input: `x = 10000, y = 10000, points = [[9999, 9999], [10000, 10000], [10000, 9998]]`\n   - Description: Tests the function's handling of points at the upper limit"

The expected output should still include all categories with a count of 0.\n\n2. **Single Account Below Low Salary**:\n   - Input: `Accounts` table with one account having an income of 15000.\n   - Description: This tests the lower boundary condition for the \"Low Salary\" category. The expected output should show 1 account in \"Low Salary\" and 0 in the other categories.\n\n3. **Single Account in Average Salary**:\n   - Input: `Accounts` table with one account having an income of 25000.\n   - Description: This tests the boundary condition for the \"Average Salary\" category. The expected output should show 1 account in \"Average Salary\" and 0 in the other categories.\n\n4. **Single Account Above High Salary**:\n   - Input: `Accounts` table with one account having an income of 60000.\n   - Description: This tests the upper boundary condition for the \"High Salary\" category. The expected output should show 1 account in \"High Salary\" and 0 in the other categories.\n\n5. **Multiple Accounts with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `Accounts` table with multiple accounts, e.g., incomes of 30000, 30000, 45000, 60000, 60000.\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles duplicates.

The expected output should show counts for \"High Salary\" and 0 for the other categories.\n\n7. **Negative Income Values**:\n   - Input: `Accounts` table with negative income values, e.g., incomes of -1000, -5000, 15000.\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles invalid income values. The expected output should show the correct count for \"Low Salary\" and 0 for the other categories, as negative incomes should be considered \"Low Salary\".\n\n8. **Maximum Size Table**:\n   - Input: A large `Accounts` table with the maximum number of entries (e.g., 10^6) with a mix of incomes across all categories.\n   - Description: This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution. The expected output should accurately reflect the counts for each category without performance degradation.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios,"

If only counter-clockwise, should we clarify how to handle the last element of each layer?\n\n3. **Handling Large k Values**: Given that k can be as large as \\(10^9\\), should we optimize the number of rotations by reducing k based on the length of each layer (e.g., using \\(k \\mod \\text{layer length}\\))? \n\n4. **Output Format**: Should the output be returned as a new matrix, or can we modify the input matrix in place?

Tests basic functionality with the smallest input size.\n\n2. **Single Layer with Multiple Rotations**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests the behavior of the function when the number of rotations exceeds the number of elements in the layer. The expected output should be the same as `k = 1`.\n\n3. **Multiple Layers with Full Rotations**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]], k = 4`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where the number of rotations equals the number of elements in the outer layer, which should return the grid to its original state.\n\n4. **Large Grid with Maximum Size**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[i + j * 50 for i in range(1, 51)] for j in range(50)], k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum grid size (50x50) and a moderate number of rotations.\n\n5. **Rotating with Zero Rotations**:\n   - **Input**: `grid = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], k = 0`\n   - **Description**: Tests the edge case where no rotations are requested.

The output should be the concatenation of the array with itself, resulting in an array of size 2000.\n\n4. **Single Element with Maximum Value**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1000]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with the maximum possible value for a single element.

On the board, free cells are represented by &#39;.&#39;, white cells are represented by &#39;W&#39;, and black cells are represented by &#39;B&#39;.\n\nEach move in this game consists of choosing a free cell and changing it to the color you are playing as (either white or black). However, a move is only legal if, after changing it, the cell becomes the endpoint of a good line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).\n\nA good line is a line of three or more cells (including the endpoints) where the endpoints of the line are one color, and the remaining cells in the middle are the opposite color (no cells in the line are free). You can find examples for good lines in the figure below:\n\nGiven two integers rMove and cMove and a character color representing the color you are playing as (white or black), return true if changing cell (rMove, cMove) to color color is a legal move, or false if it is not legal.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: board = [[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;W&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;B&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;]], rMove = 4, cMove = 3, color = &quot;B&quot;\nOutput: true\nExplanation: &#39;.&#39;, &#39;W&#39;, and &#39;B&#39; are represented by the colors blue, white, and black respectively, and cell (rMove, cMove) is marked with an &#39;X&#39;.\nThe two good lines with the chosen cell as an endpoint are annotated above with the red rectangles.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: board = [[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;.&quot;],[&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;B&quot;]], rMove = 4, cMove = 4, color = &quot;W&quot;\nOutput: false\nExplanation: While there are good lines with the chosen cell as a middle cell, there are no good lines with the chosen cell as an endpoint.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tboard.length == board[r].length == 8\n\t0 <= rMove, cMove < 8\n\tboard[rMove][cMove] == &#39;.&#39;\n\tcolor is either &#39;B&#39; or &#39;W&#39;.\n\n"

The output should still satisfy the wiggle condition, but it will be the same as the input.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, ..., 50000]` (an array of size 50,000)\n   - Description: Tests the performance and efficiency of the solution with the maximum allowed input size.\n\n6. **Large Range of Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 5000, 0, 5000, 0]`\n   - Description: An array with extreme values (minimum and maximum) to ensure the algorithm handles the full range of possible input values.\n\n7. **Alternating High and Low Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 1000, 2, 999, 3, 998]`\n   - Description: An array where high and low values alternate. This tests whether the algorithm can correctly rearrange elements that are already in a non-standard order.\n\n8. **Duplicates with Varying Frequencies**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]`\n   - Description: An array with duplicates of varying frequencies. This case checks if the algorithm can handle duplicates while still achieving the wiggle sort condition.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a robust evaluation of the solution."

The expected output should also be an empty array.\n\n2. **Single Element Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1], k = 10`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the array contains only one element. No matter the value of k, the output should remain the same as the input.\n\n3. **Rotation Equal to Array Length**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where k is equal to the length of the array. The output should be the same as the input array.\n\n4. **Rotation Greater than Array Length**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 7`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where k is greater than the length of the array. The effective rotation should be `k % length`, which in this case is 2, resulting in `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.\n\n5. **All Negative Numbers**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4], k = 2`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's handling of negative numbers.

The expected output should be `[2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]`.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [i for i in range(1, 100001)], k = 100000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the function with the maximum allowed size of the array. The expected output should be the same as the input array since k equals the length.\n\n8. **Zero Rotation**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 0`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where k is zero.

Check that after calling `peek()`, the pointer does not advance.\n\n4. **Iterator with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `[3, 3, 3]`\n   - Description: Test the iterator with duplicate values. Ensure that `next()` returns the correct values in order and that `peek()` consistently returns the next value without advancing the pointer.\n\n5. **Iterator with Maximum Size**:\n   - Input: `[1, 2, ..., 1000]` (a list of integers from 1 to 1000)\n   - Description: Test the performance of the iterator with the maximum allowed size. Verify that all operations (`next()`, `peek()`, `hasNext()`) perform correctly without any performance degradation.\n\n6. **Negative Numbers**:\n   - Input: `[-1, -2, -3]`\n   - Description: Test the iterator with negative integers. Ensure that the iterator correctly handles and returns negative values for `next()` and `peek()`.\n\n7. **Iterator with Zero**:\n   - Input: `[0, 1, 2]`\n   - Description: Test the iterator with zero as an element. Ensure that `next()` and `peek()` return zero correctly and that `hasNext()` works as expected.\n\n8. **Sequential Calls to `peek()`**:\n   - Input: `[10, 20, 30]`\n   - Description: Call `peek()` multiple times before calling `next()`. Verify that multiple calls to `peek()` return the same value and that the pointer only advances after a call to `next()`.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations that are crucial for ensuring the robustness of the PeekingIterator implementation."

        "According to Wikipedia&#39;s article: &quot;The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.&quot;\n\nThe board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\n\n\tAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n\tAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n\tAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n\tAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n\nThe next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.\n\nGiven the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.\n\nNote that you do not need to return anything.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == board.length\n\tn == board[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 25\n\tboard[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nFollow up:\n\n\n\tCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\n\tIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?\n\n"

The sum should equal 10,000.\n\n7. **Negative Range**: \n   - Input: `NumArray([-10, -20, -30, -40])`, `sumRange(1, 2)`\n   - Description: Tests the behavior with a range that only includes negative numbers. The sum should be the correct total of the selected negative numbers.\n\n8. **Multiple Queries**: \n   - Input: `NumArray([1, -1, 1, -1, 1])`, `sumRange(0, 2)`, `sumRange(1, 4)`, `sumRange(0, 4)`\n   - Description: Tests the ability to handle multiple queries efficiently. Each query should return the correct sum based on the specified ranges.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a robust testing strategy for the implementation."

It ensures that the operation can be performed efficiently without timeouts or errors.\n\n8. **Employees with Zero and Negative Salaries**:\n   - Input: Salary table with employees having zero and negative salaries: `(1, 'A', 'm', 0), (2, 'B', 'f', -1500)`.\n   - Description: This tests how the update statement handles special salary values like zero and negative numbers.

Although the problem states there is exactly one island, this case can help ensure the function handles unexpected input gracefully.\n\n3. **Single Row with Land**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1]]`\n   - Description: A single row of land cells. This tests the function's ability to calculate the perimeter when the island is in a linear formation.\n\n4. **Single Column with Land**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1], [1], [1], [1]]`\n   - Description: A single column of land cells. Similar to the single row case, this tests vertical island formations.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Grid with Complex Shape**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[0]*100 for _ in range(100)]` with a complex island shape (e.g., a \"U\" shape).\n   - Description: A grid at the maximum size with a complex island shape. This tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm under maximum constraints.\n\n6. **Island with Water on All Sides**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]`\n   - Description: A vertical island with water on all sides. This checks if the function correctly identifies and counts all perimeter edges.\n\n7. **Island with Diagonal Water**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n   - Description: A diagonal arrangement of land cells. This tests if the function correctly identifies that diagonal connections do not count towards perimeter.\n\n8. **Island with Internal Water (not allowed)**:\n   - Input: `grid = [[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]]`\n   - Description: An arrangement that suggests internal water (which violates the problem constraints). This tests if the function can handle or reject invalid configurations appropriately.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including minimum and maximum input sizes, different configurations of land and water, and potential invalid inputs to ensure robustness in the solution."

This tests the basic functionality of the algorithm when the matrix is at its smallest size.\n\n2. **Single Row Matrix (1xn)**:\n   - Input: `Solution(1, 5)` followed by multiple `flip()` calls.\n   - Description: Tests the behavior of the algorithm when the matrix consists of a single row with multiple columns. This checks if the algorithm can handle horizontal flipping correctly.\n\n3. **Single Column Matrix (mx1)**:\n   - Input: `Solution(5, 1)` followed by multiple `flip()` calls.\n   - Description: Similar to the single row case, but with a single column. This tests vertical flipping and ensures the algorithm can handle this configuration.\n\n4. **Full Matrix Flip and Reset**:\n   - Input: `Solution(3, 3)` followed by 9 `flip()` calls and then a `reset()`.\n   - Description: This tests the scenario where the entire matrix is flipped to 1 and then reset back to 0.

It ensures that the returned indices are uniformly distributed among the available options.\n\n7. **Sequential Flips and Reset**:\n   - Input: `Solution(2, 2)` followed by `flip()`, `flip()`, `reset()`, and then `flip()`.\n   - Description: This tests the sequence of operations where the matrix is flipped twice, reset, and then flipped again. It checks if the reset correctly restores the matrix to its initial state.\n\n8. **Performance with Maximum Calls**:\n   - Input: `Solution(10, 10)` followed by 1000 `flip()` calls.\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the algorithm under the maximum number of allowed `flip()` calls, ensuring it operates efficiently without excessive calls to the random function.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, performance, and the correctness of the algorithm's functionality."

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Continuous Subarray Sum\" problem:\n\n1. **Minimum Length Subarray**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 1], k = 2`\n   - Description: The smallest valid subarray (length 2) that sums to a multiple of `k`. This tests the basic functionality of identifying a good subarray.\n\n2. **Subarray with Zero**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 0, 0], k = 1`\n   - Description: A subarray consisting entirely of zeros. Since the sum is zero (which is a multiple of any `k`), this tests the handling of zero values.\n\n3. **Single Element Array**:\n   - Input: `nums = [5], k = 5`\n   - Description: An array with only one element. This tests the boundary condition where the array length is less than 2, which should return false.\n\n4. **All Elements Zero**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 0, 0, 0], k = 3`\n   - Description: An array where all elements are zero. This tests if the function correctly identifies that a subarray exists that sums to zero, which is a multiple of any `k`.\n\n5. **Large Array with No Valid Subarray**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 20`\n   - Description: A larger array where no subarray sums to a multiple of `k`. This tests the performance and correctness of the solution in larger datasets.\n\n6. **Multiple Valid Subarrays**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], k = 3`\n   - Description: An array with multiple subarrays that can sum to a multiple of `k`. This tests if the algorithm can find at least one valid subarray.\n\n7. **Negative Numbers**:\n   - Input: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4], k = -3`\n   - Description: An array containing negative numbers. This tests how the function handles negative values and checks for valid subarrays that sum to a negative multiple of `k`.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1] * 100000, k = 1`\n   - Description: A very large array where every element is `1` and `k` is `1`. This tests the performance of the solution with the maximum constraints and ensures it can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\nThese edge cases cover a broad range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations."

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Game Play Analysis IV\" problem:\n\n1. **Empty Table**:\n   - Input: No records in the Activity table.\n   - Description: This tests how the solution handles the absence of data. The expected output should be `0.00` since there are no players.\n\n2. **Single Player, Single Day**:\n   - Input: Activity table with one player who logged in on one day (e.g., player_id = 1, event_date = '2023-01-01', games_played = 5).\n   - Description: This tests the scenario where there is only one player and they did not log in the next day. The expected output should be `0.00`.\n\n3. **Single Player, Two Consecutive Days**:\n   - Input: Activity table with one player who logged in on two consecutive days (e.g., player_id = 1, event_date = '2023-01-01', games_played = 5; player_id = 1, event_date = '2023-01-02', games_played = 3).\n   - Description: This checks if the solution correctly identifies a player who logged in again the day after their first login. The expected output should be `1.00`.\n\n4. **Multiple Players with No Consecutive Logins**:\n   - Input: Activity table with multiple players who logged in on different days without any consecutive logins (e.g., player_id = 1 on '2023-01-01', player_id = 2 on '2023-01-03').\n   - Description: This tests the scenario where no players logged in the day after their first login. The expected output should be `0.00`.\n\n5. **Multiple Players with Some Consecutive Logins**:\n   - Input: Activity table with multiple players where some logged in the day after their first login (e.g., player_id = 1 on '2023-01-01', player_id = 1 on '2023-01-02'; player_id = 2 on '2023-01-03').\n   - Description: This checks if the solution correctly calculates the fraction of players who logged in again. The expected output should be `0.50` if 1 out of 2 players logged in again.\n\n6. **Players with Duplicate Logins on the Same Day**:\n   - Input: Activity table with a player logging in multiple times on the same day (e.g., player_id = 1, device_id = 1, event_date = '2023-01-01', games_played = 5; player_id = 1, device_id = 2, event_date = '2023-01-01', games_played = 3).\n   - Description: This tests how the solution handles duplicate entries for the same player on"
