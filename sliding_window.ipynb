        "   - If it is, move the start pointer to the right of the last occurrence of that character.\n",
        "   - Update the last index of the character in the hash map.\n",
        "   - Calculate the current length of the substring and update the maximum length found so far.\n",

This checks if the function can correctly identify multiple valid subarrays and return the lexicographically smallest indices.\n\n3. **Maximum Input Size**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, ..., 20000]`, `k = 6666`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the solution with the upper limit of constraints. It checks if the function can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n4. **Negative and Positive Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [-1, 2, 3, -4, 5, 6, 7, -8, 9]`, `k = 2`\n   - Description: This case includes both negative and positive numbers.

The expected output should be 0 since there are no elements to count.\n\n2. **Single Element (1)**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1], k = 0`\n   - Description: Tests the simplest case where the array contains only a single 1.

The expected output should be `0` since there are no characters to form a substring.\n\n2. **Single Character String**  \n   **Input:** `text = \"a\"`  \n   **Output:** `1`  \n   **Description:** Tests the case where the string has only one character. The longest repeated character substring is the character itself.\n\n3. **Two Different Characters**  \n   **Input:** `text = \"ab\"`  \n   **Output:** `1`  \n   **Description:** Tests a minimal case with two different characters. The longest repeated substring after any swap will still be `1`.\n\n4. **Two Identical Characters**  \n   **Input:** `text = \"aa\"`  \n   **Output:** `2`  \n   **Description:** Tests a minimal case with two identical characters. The longest repeated substring is the entire string itself.\n\n5. **Maximum Length with All Identical Characters**  \n   **Input:** `text = \"a\" * 20000`  \n   **Output:** `20000`  \n   **Description:** Tests the upper boundary condition where the string consists of the maximum allowed length with all identical characters. The output should be equal to the length of the string.\n\n6. **Maximum Length with Alternating Characters**  \n   **Input:** `text = \"abababababababababab...\"` (10,000 'ab' pairs)  \n   **Output:** `3`  \n   **Description:** Tests performance with a maximum length string where characters alternate. A swap can create a substring of length `3` (e.g., \"aaa\").\n\n7. **String with Multiple Repeated Characters**  \n   **Input:** `text = \"aabbccddeeffgg\"`  \n   **Output:** `8`  \n   **Description:** Tests a case with multiple characters where swaps can create a longer repeated substring. The longest substring can be formed by swapping characters to create \"aaaaaa\".\n\n8. **String with One Character Dominating**  \n   **Input:** `text = \"aaabbbcccddddeee\"`  \n   **Output:** `10`  \n   **Description:** Tests a scenario where one character appears significantly more than others.

The output should also be empty since a 7-day window cannot be computed.\n\n3. **Exactly Seven Days of Transactions**:\n   - Input: Seven records, each with unique `visited_on` dates spanning seven consecutive days.\n   - Description: This tests the exact boundary condition where the moving average can be calculated for the first time. The output should show the average for that week.\n\n4. **More Than Seven Days with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: More than seven records with some duplicate `customer_id` and `visited_on` dates.\n   - Description: This tests how the system handles duplicate entries and ensures that the moving average is calculated correctly over the 7-day window.\n\n5. **Transactions with Zero Amount**:\n   - Input: Several records including some with `amount = 0`.\n   - Description: This tests how the system handles transactions where customers paid nothing. The moving average should still be computed correctly.\n\n6. **Negative Amounts**:\n   - Input: Several records including some with negative `amount` values.\n   - Description: This tests how the system handles invalid transaction amounts. The moving average should still be computed, but it raises questions about data integrity.\n\n7. **Performance with Large Dataset**:\n   - Input: A large number of records (e.g., 10,000+ transactions) spanning multiple months or years.\n   - Description: This tests the performance and efficiency of the query. It ensures that the solution can handle large datasets without timing out or crashing.\n\n8. **Gaps in Dates**:\n   - Input: Records with gaps in the `visited_on` dates (e.g., transactions on `2023-01-01`, `2023-01-03`, `2023-01-05`, etc.).\n   - Description: This tests how the system handles calculations when there are missing days in the transaction history.

The expected output should be `0` since the highest and lowest scores are the same.\n\n2. **All Elements Identical**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [50, 50, 50, 50]`, `k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where all scores are identical. The difference should be `0`, regardless of the value of `k`.\n\n3. **Minimum k Value**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `k = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the minimum value of `k`. The output should be `0` since picking any single score results in no difference.\n\n4. **Maximum k Value**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the maximum value of `k`, where all elements must be selected.

The expected output should be `100000` (100000 - 0) since all elements are either 0 or 100000.\n\n6. **Array with Negative and Positive Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]`, `k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario with both negative and positive scores. The expected output should be `10` (10 - 0 or 5 - (-5)).\n\n7. **Array with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles duplicates. The expected output should be `1` (2 - 1 or 3 - 2).\n\n8. **Consecutive Numbers with Maximum k**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, `k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests a straightforward case with consecutive integers."

The median should remain constant regardless of the window position.\n\n3. **Even Number of Elements in Window**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], k = 4`\n   - **Description**: The window size is even, which means the median will be the average of the two middle numbers.
