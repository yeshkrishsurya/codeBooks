        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider when solving the \"Letter Combinations of a Phone Number\" problem:\n\n1. **Empty Input**:\n   - **Input**: `\"\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's handling of an empty string. The expected output should be an empty list `[]`.\n\n2. **Single Digit Input**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest non-empty case with a single digit. The expected output should be `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]`.\n\n3. **Maximum Length Input**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2345\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's ability to handle the maximum allowed input length (4 digits). The expected output should be a combination of letters corresponding to digits 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n4. **All Digits Input**:\n   - **Input**: `\"23456789\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's performance and correctness with the maximum number of digits (8 digits). This will generate a large number of combinations.\n\n5. **Repeated Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `\"222\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles repeated digits. The expected output should be combinations of letters corresponding to the digit '2', which should be `[\"aaa\", \"aab\", \"aac\", ..., \"ccc\"]`.\n\n6. **Leading Zeros**:\n   - **Input**: `\"023\"`\n   - **Description**: Although the problem states that digits will be from 2-9, this tests how the function handles unexpected input. The expected output should be based only on the valid digit '2' and should return combinations for that digit, which is `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]`.\n\n7. **Non-Sequential Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `\"29\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's ability to handle non-sequential digits. The expected output should be combinations of letters corresponding to digits 2 and 9, which should be `[\"aw\", \"ax\", \"ay\", \"az\", \"bw\", \"bx\", \"by\", \"bz\", \"cw\", \"cx\", \"cy\", \"cz\"]`.\n\n8. **Edge Case with Maximum Combinations**:\n   - **Input**: `\"79\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's ability to handle digits that correspond to letters with the maximum number of combinations. The expected output should be combinations of letters corresponding to digits 7 and 9, which should be `[\"pq\", \"pr\", \"ps\", \"qt\", \"qu\", \"qv\", \"rt\", \"ru\", \"rv\", \"st\", \"su\", \"sv\"]`.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations."

The expected output should include all unique permutations of the four elements.\n\n8. **All Identical Elements**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [2, 2, 2, 2]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the edge case where all elements are identical. The expected output should be `[[2, 2, 2, 2]]`, as there is only one unique permutation regardless of the number of identical elements. \n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases with empty inputs, single elements, duplicates, and performance considerations with maximum input sizes."

It checks if the algorithm correctly handles division and parentheses.\n\n7. **Negative Result Check**: \n   - Input: `cards = [1, 2, 2, 2]`\n   - Description: This tests the algorithm's ability to recognize that certain combinations will lead to negative results and cannot yield 24, such as `2 - (2 + 1)`.\n\n8. **Performance Case with Large Combinations**: \n   - Input: `cards = [5, 5, 5, 5]`\n   - Description: This tests the algorithm's efficiency and performance when dealing with multiple combinations of the same number, ensuring it can handle larger sets of operations without excessive computation time.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's robustness."

The expected output should be \"0\", as there is only one digit available.\n\n2. **Single Digit Password with Multiple Options**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 1`, `k = 10`\n   - **Description**: This tests a scenario where the password is a single digit but there are multiple digits available (0-9). The output could be any single digit from \"0\" to \"9\".\n\n3. **Two-Digit Password with Minimum Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 2`, `k = 2`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case with a two-digit password and only two possible digits (0 and 1). The expected output is \"01100\", which ensures all combinations of the two digits are covered.\n\n4. **Maximum Password Length with Minimum Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 4`, `k = 1`\n   - **Description**: This tests the edge case where the password length is at its maximum but there is only one digit available.

The expected output should cover all combinations of four digits from 0 to 9, resulting in a string of length 14 (e.g., \"0001020304050607080910\").\n\n6. **All Digits Used in Password**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 3`, `k = 4`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where the password can include all digits from 0 to 3. The expected output could be \"000123\", which ensures that all combinations of three digits are covered.\n\n7. **Performance with Maximum Constraints**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 4`, `k = 10` (testing performance with the maximum constraints)\n   - **Description**: This checks how the algorithm performs under maximum constraints. The expected output should be a valid string that unlocks the safe, and the performance should be efficient without timing out.\n\n8. **Repeated Digits in Password**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where the password could potentially have repeated digits (e.g., \"001\").

The expected output should be numbers with the same consecutive digits, which are valid two-digit numbers (e.g., 00 is invalid).\n\n2. **Maximum n with k = 0**: \n   - Input: `n = 9, k = 0`\n   - Description: This tests the maximum value of `n` while keeping `k` at 0. The only valid output should be the number 111111111, as all digits must be the same.\n\n3. **k = 9**: \n   - Input: `n = 3, k = 9`\n   - Description: This edge case tests the scenario where the maximum difference is allowed between consecutive digits. The only valid numbers should be those that start with 1 or 9 (e.g., 909, 101).\n\n4. **Leading Zeros**: \n   - Input: `n = 3, k = 1`\n   - Description: This case checks for valid outputs while ensuring no leading zeros are present. The expected output should include numbers like 101, 121, 212, etc., but exclude any with leading zeros.\n\n5. **Single Digit Output**: \n   - Input: `n = 1, k = 0`\n   - Description: Although `n` must be at least 2 according to the constraints, testing with `n = 1` can help ensure that the function handles invalid inputs gracefully or returns an empty array.\n\n6. **Maximum k with n = 2**: \n   - Input: `n = 2, k = 9`\n   - Description: This tests the scenario where `n` is at its minimum and `k` is at its maximum. The only valid pairs should be (1, 0) and (9, 0), resulting in the output [90, 10].\n\n7. **Performance Case**: \n   - Input: `n = 9, k = 1`\n   - Description: This tests the upper limits of the input size with a small difference between consecutive digits. The expected output should include a large number of valid combinations, testing the efficiency of the solution.\n\n8. **No Valid Numbers**: \n   - Input: `n = 3, k = 8`\n   - Description: This case checks for scenarios where no valid numbers can be formed. The expected output should be an empty array, as no three-digit numbers can have consecutive digits differing by 8 without leading zeros or exceeding the digit range.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations that"

There are no permutations to consider.\n\n2. **Single Element Array**  \n   Input: `nums = [1]`  \n   Output: `0`  \n   Description: An array with a single element cannot form any adjacent pairs, hence no squareful permutations.\n\n3. **Two Elements with Perfect Square Sum**  \n   Input: `nums = [1, 3]`  \n   Output: `1`  \n   Description: The only permutation `[1, 3]` has a sum of 4 (which is a perfect square), while `[3, 1]` does not. This tests basic pair formation.\n\n4. **Two Elements with Non-Perfect Square Sum**  \n   Input: `nums = [2, 3]`  \n   Output: `0`  \n   Description: Both permutations `[2, 3]` and `[3, 2]` do not yield a perfect square sum (5). This checks for failure cases.\n\n5. **Array with Duplicates**  \n   Input: `nums = [2, 2, 2]`  \n   Output: `1`  \n   Description: All elements are the same, and they can only form one valid squareful permutation. This tests handling of duplicates.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Array with Mixed Values**  \n   Input: `nums = [1, 8, 17, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`  \n   Output: Varies based on valid permutations.  \n   Description: A maximum size array to test performance and ensure the algorithm can handle larger inputs efficiently.\n\n7. **Array with Large Values**  \n   Input: `nums = [0, 1, 3, 8, 9, 16]`  \n   Output: Varies based on valid permutations.  \n   Description: Tests the algorithm's ability to handle large integers and check for perfect square sums.\n\n8. **Array with No Valid Permutations**  \n   Input: `nums = [4, 5, 6]`  \n   Output: `0`  \n   Description: None of the permutations yield adjacent pairs that sum to a perfect square. This tests the algorithm's ability to identify failure cases effectively.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including empty inputs, single elements, duplicates, performance concerns, and the handling of both small and large integers."

For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).\n\nReturn the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: balls = [1,1]\nOutput: 1.00000\nExplanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:\n- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2\n- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2\nIn both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: balls = [2,1,1]\nOutput: 0.66667\nExplanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]\nThis set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):\n[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]\nAfter that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.\nWe can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.\nProbability is 8/12 = 0.66667\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: balls = [1,2,1,2]\nOutput: 0.60000\nExplanation: The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.\nProbability = 108 / 180 = 0.6\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= balls.length <= 8\n\t1 <= balls[i] <= 6\n\tsum(balls) is even.\n\n"

This tests the function's handling of empty inputs.\n\n2. **Single Transfer Request**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 2`, `requests = [[0, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: A case with only one transfer request between two buildings. This checks if the function can handle a minimal valid request.\n\n3. **All Requests to the Same Building**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 3`, `requests = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: All employees want to transfer to the same building. This tests if the function correctly identifies that not all requests can be fulfilled while maintaining the net balance.\n\n4. **Cyclic Transfers**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 4`, `requests = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 0]]`\n   - **Description**: A scenario where each building has a request that forms a cycle.

This tests if the function can handle and correctly count unique requests.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 20`, `requests = [[i, (i + 1) % 20] for i in range(16)]`\n   - **Description**: A case with the maximum number of buildings and requests. This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution under upper limit constraints.\n\n8. **Balanced and Unbalanced Requests**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 4`, `requests = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 0], [0, 2]]`\n   - **Description**"

        "Here are several important edge cases to consider when solving the \"Maximize Grid Happiness\" problem:\n\n1. **Minimum Grid Size with No People**:\n   - **Input**: `m = 1, n = 1, introvertsCount = 0, extrovertsCount = 0`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the grid is the smallest possible size and no people are present. The expected output should be `0` since there are no individuals to contribute to happiness.\n\n2. **Single Introvert in a 1x1 Grid**:\n   - **Input**: `m = 1, n = 1, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 0`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where there is one introvert in the smallest grid. The expected output should be `120`, as the introvert has no neighbors to affect their happiness.\n\n3. **Single Extrovert in a 1x1 Grid**:\n   - **Input**: `m = 1, n = 1, introvertsCount = 0, extrovertsCount = 1`\n   - **Description**: Similar to the previous case, but with an extrovert. The expected output should be `40`, as the extrovert has no neighbors.\n\n4. **Maximum Grid Size with Maximum People**:\n   - **Input**: `m = 5, n = 5, introvertsCount = 6, extrovertsCount = 6`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the grid is at its maximum size and the maximum number of people are placed. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle larger inputs and ensure it calculates happiness correctly.\n\n5. **All Introverts in a 2x3 Grid**:\n   - **Input**: `m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 6, extrovertsCount = 0`\n   - **Description**: All cells are filled with introverts. The expected output should be calculated based on the number of neighbors each introvert has, which will test the algorithm's handling of neighbor interactions.\n\n6. **All Extroverts in a 2x2 Grid**:\n   - **Input**: `m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 0, extrovertsCount = 4`\n   - **Description**: All cells are filled with extroverts. This will test how the happiness calculation works when all individuals are extroverts and how their happiness is affected by their neighbors.\n\n7. **Mixed Introverts and Extroverts with Maximum Happiness**:\n   - **Input**: `m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 2`\n   - **Description**: This tests the optimal arrangement of introverts and ext"

The expected output should be empty (`[]`) since it's impossible to represent a valid time with all LEDs on.\n\n4. **All Possible Hours with Minimum Minutes**:\n   - **Input**: `turnedOn = 4`\n   - **Description**: This case checks the scenario where there are 4 LEDs on, testing combinations of hours and minutes.

Expected output is 10.\n\n7. **Consecutive Even and Odd Inputs**:\n   - Input: `n = 6` and `n = 7`\n   - Description: Testing with consecutive even and odd numbers to ensure that the function behaves consistently. Expected outputs are 40 for `n = 6` and 80 for `n = 7`.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case (n = 10)**:\n   - Input: `n = 10`\n   - Description: A larger input to check the performance of the algorithm without hitting the maximum constraint. Expected output is 512.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including minimum and maximum inputs, small and medium sizes, and performance considerations to ensure the solution is robust and efficient."
