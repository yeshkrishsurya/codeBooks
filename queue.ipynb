This tests the base case where no swaps are needed.\n\n2. **Single Swap Needed**:\n   - Input: `s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"ba\"`\n   - Description: A simple case where one swap is required to transform `s1` into `s2`. This tests the basic functionality of the swap operation.\n\n3. **Two Swaps Needed**:\n   - Input: `s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"bca\"`\n   - Description: A case where two swaps are required to achieve the transformation. This checks if the algorithm can correctly count multiple swaps.\n\n4. **Maximum Length Strings with All Unique Characters**:\n   - Input: `s1 = \"abcdefabcdefabcd\", s2 = \"badcfeabcdefcba\"`\n   - Description: Both strings are of maximum length (20 characters) with unique characters.

In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.\n"

        "## Test Edge Cases",
        "",
        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider when solving the \"Implement Queue using Stacks\" problem:\n\n1. **Empty Queue Operations**:\n   - Test calling `pop()` and `peek()` on an empty queue. Ensure that the implementation handles these operations correctly, as they are guaranteed to be valid according to the problem statement. This will confirm that the implementation does not crash or throw unexpected errors.\n\n2. **Single Element Queue**:\n   - Push a single element (e.g., `1`), then call `pop()` and `peek()`. This tests the behavior of the queue when it contains only one element, ensuring that both operations return the correct value and that the queue is empty afterward.\n\n3. **Multiple Identical Elements**:\n   - Push multiple identical elements (e.g., `1, 1, 1`) and then perform `pop()` operations. This tests how the queue handles duplicates and whether it maintains the correct order of elements.\n\n4. **Order of Operations**:\n   - Perform a sequence of operations: `push(1)`, `push(2)`, `pop()`, `push(3)`, `peek()`, `pop()`, `empty()`. This tests the queue's ability to maintain FIFO order through a series of mixed operations.\n\n5. **Performance with Maximum Calls**:\n   - Execute the maximum number of operations allowed (100 calls) with a mix of `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`. This tests the performance and efficiency of the implementation under load, ensuring it can handle the upper limits of the constraints.\n\n6. **Interleaved Operations**:\n   - Interleave `push` and `pop` operations (e.g., `push(1)`, `pop()`, `push(2)`, `push(3)`, `pop()`, `push(4)`). This tests the queue's ability to handle continuous additions and removals without breaking the FIFO order.\n\n7. **Peek After Multiple Operations**:\n   - After a series of `push` and `pop` operations, call `peek()` to ensure it returns the correct front element. For example, execute `push(1)`, `push(2)`, `pop()`, `push(3)`, then `peek()`. This checks that the queue maintains the correct state after multiple operations.\n\n8. **Empty Check After Multiple Operations**:\n   - After performing a series of operations that include both `push` and `pop`, check the `empty()` method at various points to ensure it accurately reflects the queue's state. For example, after pushing three elements and popping two, `empty()` should return `false`, and after popping the last element, it should return `true`.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios that will help ensure the robustness and correctness of the queue implementation using stacks."

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called &quot;Ring Buffer&quot;.\n\nOne of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.\n\nImplement the MyCircularQueue class:\n\n\n\tMyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.\n\tint Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n\tint Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n\tboolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\n\tboolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\n\tboolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.\n\tboolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.\n\n\nYou must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput\n[&quot;MyCircularQueue&quot;, &quot;enQueue&quot;, &quot;enQueue&quot;, &quot;enQueue&quot;, &quot;enQueue&quot;, &quot;Rear&quot;, &quot;isFull&quot;, &quot;deQueue&quot;, &quot;enQueue&quot;, &quot;Rear&quot;]\n[[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]\nOutput\n[null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]\n\nExplanation\nMyCircularQueue myCircularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3);\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(1); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return False\nmyCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 3\nmyCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True\nmyCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 4\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= k <= 1000\n\t0 <= value <= 1000\n\tAt most 3000 calls will be made to&nbsp;enQueue, deQueue,&nbsp;Front,&nbsp;Rear,&nbsp;isEmpty, and&nbsp;isFull.\n\n"

        "## Test Edge Cases",
        "",
        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider when solving the \"Design Circular Deque\" problem:\n\n1. **Empty Deque Operations**:\n   - Test the behavior of the deque when it is empty. For example, attempt to `deleteFront` and `deleteLast` when no elements are present. Ensure that these operations return false or an appropriate error message.\n\n2. **Single Element Deque**:\n   - Initialize the deque with a capacity of 1, then add one element. Test the following operations: `getFront`, `getRear`, `deleteFront`, and `deleteLast`. Ensure that after deletion, the deque is empty and further operations reflect that.\n\n3. **Maximum Size Deque**:\n   - Create a deque with a maximum size (e.g., 5) and fill it to capacity. Test adding another element to ensure it correctly rejects the operation. Then, remove elements one by one and verify that the deque behaves correctly after each operation.\n\n4. **Wrap-Around Behavior**:\n   - Fill the deque to capacity, then remove a few elements, and add new elements to ensure the circular nature of the deque is maintained. Check that the `getFront` and `getRear` methods return the correct values after wrap-around.\n\n5. **Null and Special Values**:\n   - If the deque allows for null values (depending on the implementation), test adding null as an element. Verify that it can be added and removed correctly. If not allowed, ensure the implementation handles this case gracefully.\n\n6. **Negative and Zero Values**:\n   - Test inserting negative numbers and zero into the deque. Ensure that these values are handled correctly and that operations such as `getFront` and `getRear` return the expected results.\n\n7. **Duplicate Values**:\n   - Add multiple instances of the same value to the deque. Test the behavior of the deque when performing operations like `deleteFront` and `deleteLast` to ensure that duplicates are handled correctly.\n\n8. **Performance with Large Size**:\n   - Test the performance of the deque when initialized with a very large size (e.g., 10^6). Perform a series of operations (insertions and deletions) to evaluate the time complexity and ensure that the implementation can handle large data efficiently without performance degradation.\n\nThese edge cases will help ensure that the implementation of the circular deque is robust and handles a variety of scenarios correctly."

In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:\n\n\n\tBan one senator&#39;s right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.\n\tAnnounce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.\n\n\nGiven a string senate representing each senator&#39;s party belonging. The character &#39;R&#39; and &#39;D&#39; represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.\n\nThe round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.\n\nSuppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be &quot;Radiant&quot; or &quot;Dire&quot;.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: senate = &quot;RD&quot;\nOutput: &quot;Radiant&quot;\nExplanation: \nThe first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator&#39;s right in round 1. \nAnd the second senator can&#39;t exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. \nAnd in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: senate = &quot;RDD&quot;\nOutput: &quot;Dire&quot;\nExplanation: \nThe first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator&#39;s right in round 1. \nAnd the second senator can&#39;t exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. \nAnd the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator&#39;s right in round 1. \nAnd in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == senate.length\n\t1 <= n <= 104\n\tsenate[i] is either &#39;R&#39; or &#39;D&#39;.\n\n"

This tests the algorithm's handling of the smallest input size.\n\n2. **Single Element Matrix (1x1 with 1)**:\n   - Input: `mat = [[1]]`\n   - Description: A matrix with a single element that is 1. This checks if the algorithm correctly identifies the distance to the nearest zero when there is only one cell.\n\n3. **All Zeros Matrix**:\n   - Input: `mat = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]`\n   - Description: A matrix where all elements are zero. This tests if the algorithm can handle cases where no distance calculations are necessary.\n\n4. **Single Row with Mixed Values**:\n   - Input: `mat = [[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]]`\n   - Description: A single row matrix with mixed values of 0s and 1s. This checks if the algorithm correctly calculates distances in a horizontal arrangement.\n\n5. **Single Column with Mixed Values**:\n   - Input: `mat = [[1], [0], [1], [1]]`\n   - Description: A single column matrix with mixed values. This tests the vertical distance calculations.\n\n6. **Large Matrix with Sparse Zeros**:\n   - Input: `mat = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]`\n   - Description: A larger matrix (3x5) with a single zero in the center. This tests the algorithm's performance with sparse zeros.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Matrix (100x100)**:\n   - Input: `mat = [[1]*100 for _ in range(100)]` with one `0` at `mat[50][50]`\n   - Description: A maximum size matrix filled with 1s except for one zero. This tests the algorithm's efficiency and performance under the upper constraint limit.\n\n8. **Edge Case with Multiple Zeros**:\n   - Input: `mat = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]]`\n   - Description: A matrix with multiple zeros in different positions. This checks if the algorithm correctly calculates the distances to the nearest zero from various points in the matrix.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including minimum and maximum input sizes, edge cases, and performance considerations."
