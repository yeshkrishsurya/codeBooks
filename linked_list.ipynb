The expected output should also be an empty list.\n\n2. **Single Element List**:\n   - **Input**: `head = [1]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the list contains only one node.

For example, calling `get(0)` or `deleteAtIndex(0)` should return -1 or do nothing, respectively.\n\n2. **Single Element List**:\n   - Add a single element to the list using `addAtHead(10)` and then test `get(0)` to ensure it returns 10. Also, test `deleteAtIndex(0)` and then call `get(0)` again to confirm it returns -1.\n\n3. **Adding at the Head and Tail**:\n   - Start with an empty list, add elements using both `addAtHead` and `addAtTail`, and verify the order of elements. For instance, after `addAtHead(5)` and `addAtTail(10)`, calling `get(0)` should return 5 and `get(1)` should return 10.\n\n4. **Adding at Invalid Index**:\n   - Attempt to add an element at an index greater than the current length of the list (e.g., `addAtIndex(5, 20)` when the list has only 3 elements). Ensure that the list remains unchanged and that subsequent `get` calls return the expected values.\n\n5. **Adding at the Last Index**:\n   - Test adding an element at the last valid index (equal to the length of the list). For example, if the list has 3 elements, calling `addAtIndex(3, 15)` should append 15 to the end, and `get(3)` should return 15.\n\n6. **Deleting from the Middle**:\n   - Create a list with multiple elements (e.g., `addAtHead(1)`, `addAtTail(2)`, `addAtTail(3)`) and then delete an element from the middle (e.g., `deleteAtIndex(1)`). Verify that the list updates correctly and that `get(1)` returns the new middle value.\n\n7. **Duplicate Values**:\n   - Add duplicate values to the list (e.g., `addAtHead(5)`, `addAtTail(5)`, `addAtTail(5)`) and ensure that `get` calls return the correct values based on the index. For instance, `get(0)`, `get(1)`, and `get(2)` should all return 5.\n\n8. **Performance Test with Maximum Operations**:\n   - Perform the maximum number of operations allowed (2000 calls) to test the performance and ensure that the linked list implementation handles the load without errors or performance degradation.

The output should contain the single element in the first part.\n\n4. **List Length Less Than k**:\n   - **Input**: `head = [1, 2]`, `k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the number of nodes in the list is less than k.

        "Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.\n\nA skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\n\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).\n\nSee more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list\n\nImplement the Skiplist class:\n\n\n\tSkiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.\n\tbool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.\n\tvoid add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.\n\tbool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\n\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput\n[&quot;Skiplist&quot;, &quot;add&quot;, &quot;add&quot;, &quot;add&quot;, &quot;search&quot;, &quot;add&quot;, &quot;search&quot;, &quot;erase&quot;, &quot;erase&quot;, &quot;search&quot;]\n[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false]\n\nExplanation\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0); // return False\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1); // return True\nskiplist.erase(0);  // return False, 0 is not in skiplist.\nskiplist.erase(1);  // return True\nskiplist.search(1); // return False, 1 has already been erased.\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t0 <= num, target <= 2 * 104\n\tAt most 5 * 104 calls will be made to search, add, and erase.\n\n"

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Swapping Nodes in a Linked List\" problem:\n\n1. **Empty List**:\n   - Input: `head = []`, `k = 1`\n   - Description: The linked list is empty. This tests how the function handles a case with no nodes.\n\n2. **Single Node List**:\n   - Input: `head = [1]`, `k = 1`\n   - Description: The linked list contains only one node. This tests if the function can handle the smallest non-empty list without attempting to swap.\n\n3. **Two Node List**:\n   - Input: `head = [1, 2]`, `k = 1`\n   - Description: A two-node list where the first and last nodes are swapped. This tests the basic functionality of the swap operation.\n\n4. **List with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `head = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, `k = 2`\n   - Description: A list with duplicate values. This tests if the function correctly identifies and swaps the appropriate nodes based on their positions rather than their values.\n\n5. **Maximum Size List**:\n   - Input: `head = [0, 1, 2, ..., 99999]`, `k = 50000`\n   - Description: A large linked list with 100,000 nodes. This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution under maximum constraints.\n\n6. **k Equals n**:\n   - Input: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `k = 5`\n   - Description: The value of k is equal to the length of the list. This tests if the function can correctly identify and swap the first and last nodes.\n\n7. **k Equals 1**:\n   - Input: `head = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `k = 1`\n   - Description: The value of k is 1, which means the first node should be swapped with the last node. This tests the function's ability to handle edge cases where the first node is involved in the swap.\n\n8. **List with Zero Values**:\n   - Input: `head = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `k = 3`\n   - Description: A list where all node values are zero. This tests if the function can handle cases where all values are the same and still perform the swap correctly. \n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations."

The output should always be the value of that single node.\n\n2. **Two Node List**:\n   - Input: `head = [1, 2]`\n   - Description: A basic case with two nodes. Ensure that both values have an equal probability of being returned when `getRandom()` is called multiple times.\n\n3. **List with Duplicate Values**:\n   - Input: `head = [1, 1, 1, 1]`\n   - Description: Test a linked list where all nodes have the same value. The output should always be that value, but it should still confirm that the random selection mechanism works correctly.\n\n4. **List with Negative and Positive Values**:\n   - Input: `head = [-1, 0, 1]`\n   - Description: Ensure that the implementation can handle both negative and positive integers, and that each value can be returned with equal probability.\n\n5. **Large List (Maximum Size)**:\n   - Input: `head = [0, 1, 2, ..., 9999]` (a linked list with 10,000 nodes)\n   - Description: Test the performance and efficiency of the solution with the maximum number of nodes allowed. Verify that the random selection is still uniform.\n\n6. **List with Zero Values**:\n   - Input: `head = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - Description: Similar to the duplicate values case, but specifically testing the behavior when all values are zero. The output should consistently be zero.\n\n7. **Long List with Mixed Values**:\n   - Input: `head = [1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3]`\n   - Description: A longer list with a mix of positive and negative values. This tests the random selection across a wider range of values.\n\n8. **Performance with Random Calls**:\n   - Input: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and call `getRandom()` 10,000 times.\n   - Description: Evaluate the performance of the `getRandom()` method under heavy load, ensuring that the method can handle repeated calls efficiently and that the distribution of returned values is uniform.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution's correctness and efficiency."

Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.\n\nReturn the head of the flattened list.

The expected output is the node itself.\n\n4. **Two Nodes with Cycle**:\n   - **Input**: `head = [1, 2]`, `pos = 0`\n   - **Description**: This tests a linked list with two nodes where the second node points back to the first node, forming a cycle.
