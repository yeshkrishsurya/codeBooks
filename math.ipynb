The expected output should be 1, as the bulb remains on.\n\n2. **Single Press with Multiple Bulbs**:\n   - Input: `n = 3`, `presses = 1`\n   - Description: This tests the behavior with three bulbs and one press. The expected output is 4, as detailed in the example.\n\n3. **Multiple Presses with Single Bulb**:\n   - Input: `n = 1`, `presses = 3`\n   - Description: This tests how multiple presses affect a single bulb. The expected output should be 2, as the bulb can be toggled on and off.\n\n4. **Even Number of Bulbs with Maximum Presses**:\n   - Input: `n = 1000`, `presses = 1000`\n   - Description: This tests the upper limit of the constraints with the maximum number of bulbs and presses. It checks for performance and correctness under maximum input sizes.\n\n5. **Odd Number of Bulbs with Zero Presses**:\n   - Input: `n = 999`, `presses = 0`\n   - Description: This tests the case with an odd number of bulbs and no presses. The expected output should be 1, as all bulbs remain on.\n\n6. **Even Number of Presses**:\n   - Input: `n = 4`, `presses = 2`\n   - Description: This checks how the system behaves with an even number of presses. The expected output should account for combinations of button presses leading to different bulb states.\n\n7. **Maximum Bulbs with Minimum Presses**:\n   - Input: `n = 1000`, `presses = 1`\n   - Description: This tests the case with the maximum number of bulbs and only one press. The expected output should be 3, as it can toggle all bulbs off, toggle even bulbs, or toggle odd bulbs.\n\n8. **All Buttons Pressed Once**:\n   - Input: `n = 5`, `presses = 4`\n   - Description: This tests a scenario where all buttons can be pressed in various combinations. It checks the complexity of states generated by multiple presses and the interactions between the buttons.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, performance edge cases, and special values, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution."

This tests the function's ability to correctly count multiple primes.\n\n3. **No Prime Set Bits**:\n   - **Input**: `left = 8`, `right = 8`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where the only number in the range has a non-prime number of set bits (1 set bit for 8). \n\n4. **Maximum Range Test**:\n   - **Input**: `left = 1`, `right = 1000000`\n   - **Description**: This tests the upper limit of the range to ensure the function can handle large inputs efficiently and correctly count the prime set bits.\n\n5. **Large Range with Small Difference**:\n   - **Input**: `left = 100000`, `right = 100100`\n   - **Description**: This tests the function's performance and correctness when the range is large but the difference is small, checking how well it handles a large number of calculations in a constrained range.\n\n6. **All Even Numbers**:\n   - **Input**: `left = 2`, `right = 10`\n   - **Description**: This tests a range of even numbers where the set bits vary. It checks if the function can correctly identify primes among even numbers.\n\n7. **All Odd Numbers**:\n   - **Input**: `left = 1`, `right = 15`\n   - **Description**: This tests a range of odd numbers, ensuring that the function can handle cases where all numbers have odd set bits.\n\n8. **Edge Case with Maximum Difference**:\n   - **Input**: `left = 1`, `right = 10000`\n   - **Description**: This tests the maximum allowed difference between `left` and `right` to ensure the function performs well and accurately counts prime set bits over a large range. \n\nThese test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, performance considerations, and special conditions relevant to the problem domain."

Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like &quot;2x&quot; or &quot;-x&quot;.\n\n\nExpressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.\n\n\n\tFor example, expression = &quot;1 + 2 * 3&quot; has an answer of [&quot;7&quot;].\n\n\nThe format of the output is as follows:\n\n\n\tFor each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.\n\t\n\t\tFor example, we would never write a term like &quot;b*a*c&quot;, only &quot;a*b*c&quot;.\n\t\n\t\n\tTerms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.\n\t\n\t\tFor example, &quot;a*a*b*c&quot; has degree 4.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)

There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as a 2D array ghosts, where ghosts[i] = [xi, yi] represents the starting position of the ith ghost. All inputs are integral coordinates.\n\nEach turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either move 1 unit in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west, or stay still.

For example, if 'X' and 'O' both have three in a row, how should we evaluate the board's validity?\n\n3. **Empty Squares**: Should we consider the presence of empty squares when determining if the board state is valid? Specifically, how many empty squares can be present in a valid game state?\n\n4. **Input Format**: Can you clarify the expected input format for the board? Should it be strictly a 3x3 array of strings, or can it be represented in other ways?\n\n5. **Performance Requirements**: Are there any performance constraints or limits on the number of moves that need to be considered, or is the problem strictly limited to evaluating the current state of a 3x3 board?"

This tests how the function handles edge cases of invalid rectangles.\n\n7. **Large Coordinates**:\n   - Input: `rec1 = [0, 0, 1000000000, 1000000000]`, `rec2 = [500000000, 500000000, 1500000000, 1500000000]`\n   - Description: The rectangles have very large coordinates. This tests the performance and correctness with maximum values.\n\n8. **Identical Rectangles**:\n   - Input: `rec1 = [1, 1, 2, 2]`, `rec2 = [1, 1, 2, 2]`\n   - Description: Both rectangles are identical. This tests the function's ability to recognize complete overlap.\n\nThese edge"

The output should be `[5, 3]`.\n\n3. **Multiple Boxes with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `aliceSizes = [1, 1, 2]`, `bobSizes = [2, 2, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the algorithm handles duplicates in the candy boxes and still finds a valid swap.\n\n4. **Large Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `aliceSizes = [1] * 10000`, `bobSizes = [2] * 10000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum allowed size for both arrays. This checks for efficiency and correctness under large inputs.\n\n5. **Large Values in Boxes**:\n   - **Input**: `aliceSizes = [100000]`, `bobSizes = [99999, 100001]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the algorithm's ability to handle large candy counts and ensure it correctly identifies the swap.\n\n6. **Sum Difference is Even**:\n   - **Input**: `aliceSizes = [3, 5, 7]`, `bobSizes = [1, 2, 4]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a scenario where the sum difference is even, ensuring that the algorithm can find a valid swap despite the sums being even.\n\n7. **Negative Values (Invalid Case)**:\n   - **Input**: `aliceSizes = [1, 2]`, `bobSizes = [-1, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Although the problem guarantees positive integers, testing with negative values can help ensure the algorithm correctly handles invalid inputs.\n\n8. **Sum Difference is Odd**:\n   - **Input**: `aliceSizes = [1, 2, 3]`, `bobSizes = [4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the algorithm's ability to find a valid swap when the total sums are odd, ensuring it can handle various sum scenarios.\n\nThese edge cases will help ensure that the solution is robust, efficient, and handles a variety of scenarios that may arise in the problem domain."

The robot should return true as it will return to the origin after completing the instructions.\n\n7. **Complex Path with No Return**:\n   - **Input**: `\"GGRGGRGGRGGR\"`\n   - **Description**: A longer sequence that creates a complex path but ultimately leads the robot away from the origin.

Expected output is `1`, as it is the first day of the year.\n\n2. **Leap Year**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2016-02-29\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a leap year date. Expected output is `60`, since 2016 is a leap year and February has 29 days.\n\n3. **Non-Leap Year**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2019-02-28\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the last day of February in a non-leap year. Expected output is `59`, as there are 59 days before March 1st in 2019.\n\n4. **End of Year**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2019-12-31\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the last day of the year. Expected output is `365`, as it is the last day of the year.\n\n5. **Middle of the Year**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2019-07-01\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a date in the middle of the year. Expected output is `182`, as July 1st is the 182nd day of the year in 2019.\n\n6. **February 29 on Non-Leap Year**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2019-02-29\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests an invalid date (February 29 on a non-leap year). This should be handled gracefully, possibly by returning an error or an indication of invalid input.\n\n7. **Maximum Date**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2019-12-31\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the maximum valid date in the range. Expected output is `365`, as it is the last day of the year.\n\n8. **First Day of Each Month**:\n   - **Input**: `\"2019-01-01\"`, `\"2019-02-01\"`, `\"2019-03-01\"`, `\"2019-04-01\"`, `\"2019-05-01\"`, `\"2019-06-01\"`, `\"2019-07-01\"`, `\"2019-08-01\"`, `\"2019-09-01\"`, `\"2019-10-01\"`, `\"2019-11-01\"`, `\"2019-12-01\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the first day of each month to ensure correct day calculations.

The only valid arrangement is `[1, 2]`, which should return `1`.\n\n3. **Small Composite Input (n = 4)**:\n   - Input: `n = 4`\n   - Description: Tests a small composite number. The valid arrangements are limited due to the presence of prime indices. The output should be `2`.\n\n4. **Small Prime Count (n = 6)**:\n   - Input: `n = 6`\n   - Description: Tests a case where there are 3 primes (2, 3, 5) and 3 non-primes (1, 4, 6). The output should reflect the arrangements of primes at prime indices.\n\n5. **Larger Input with Mixed Primes and Composites (n = 10)**:\n   - Input: `n = 10`\n   - Description: Tests a larger number where the distribution of primes and composites is more complex. The output should be calculated based on the arrangements of 4 primes (2, 3, 5, 7) at the prime indices.\n\n6. **Maximum Input (n = 100)**:\n   - Input: `n = 100`\n   - Description: Tests the upper limit of the input size. This will check the performance and correctness of the algorithm under maximum constraints. The expected output is `682289015`.\n\n7. **All Primes (n = 30)**:\n   - Input: `n = 30`\n   - Description: Tests a case where there are a significant number of primes (10 primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29). This will help verify the algorithm's ability to handle larger prime counts.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case (n = 50)**:\n   - Input: `n = 50`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the algorithm with a moderate input size, where there are 15 primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47).

The probability that the first passenger gets their own seat should be 1.0.\n\n2. **Two Passengers Case (n = 2)**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 2`\n   - **Description**: This case tests the basic functionality of the algorithm. The probability that the second passenger gets their own seat should be 0.5, as the first passenger can either sit in their own seat or the second passenger's seat.\n\n3. **Three Passengers Case (n = 3)**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 3`\n   - **Description**: This case helps verify the algorithm's correctness for a small group of passengers. The expected output is 0.5, as the first passenger can either take their own seat, the second passenger's seat, or the third passenger's seat.\n\n4. **Large Input Case (n = 100,000)**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 100000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm with the maximum constraint. The expected output should still be 0.5, but the algorithm must handle large inputs without timing out.\n\n5. **Even Number of Passengers (n = 4)**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 4`\n   - **Description**: This case checks the behavior of the algorithm with an even number of passengers. The expected output is 0.5, similar to previous cases, but it helps confirm consistency across different input sizes.\n\n6. **Odd Number of Passengers (n = 5)**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5`\n   - **Description**: This case checks the behavior of the algorithm with an odd number of passengers. The expected output is still 0.5, ensuring the algorithm handles both odd and even counts correctly.\n\n7. **Stress Test with Maximum Input (n = 10^5)**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 100000`\n   - **Description**: A performance edge case that tests the algorithm's ability to compute the probability for the largest possible input size efficiently.

The angle should be calculated when the hour hand is exactly on the hour mark.\n\n2. **Midnight Case**:  \n   - **Input**: `hour = 12, minutes = 0`  \n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the clock is at midnight (12:00). The angle should be 0 degrees since both hands overlap.\n\n3. **Exact Half Past**:  \n   - **Input**: `hour = 6, minutes = 30`  \n   - **Description**: Tests a case where the minute hand is at the 6 and the hour hand is halfway between 6 and 7. The expected angle should be 15 degrees.\n\n4. **Quarter Past**:  \n   - **Input**: `hour = 9, minutes = 15`  \n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the minute hand is at the 3 and the hour hand is slightly past 9.

The expected angle should be close to 5.5 degrees.\n\n7. **Exact Overlap**:  \n   - **Input**: `hour = 12, minutes = 15`  \n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the hour hand and minute hand are exactly overlapping.

This checks if the function can handle repeated calls efficiently without performance degradation.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and specific angles that are critical for validating the correctness of the solution."

This checks if the function can handle the simplest case correctly.\n\n2. **All Same Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `num = 1111`\n   - **Description**: All digits are the same.

This checks if the function correctly avoids leading zeros.\n\n4. **Maximum Value**:\n   - **Input**: `num = 100000000`\n   - **Description**: Test the upper limit of the input constraints.

This tests if the solution can correctly identify points on the edge.\n\n3. **Darts Outside the Dartboard Radius**:\n   - Input: `darts = [[10, 10], [20, 20], [30, 30]], r = 5`\n   - Description: All darts are far outside the radius of the dartboard. The expected output should be 0.\n\n4. **Maximum Number of Darts**:\n   - Input: `darts = [[i, j] for i in range(10) for j in range(10)], r = 10`\n   - Description: A large number of darts (100 unique points) to test the performance and efficiency of the algorithm.\n\n5. **Darts at Maximum Distance**:\n   - Input: `darts = [[-10000, -10000], [10000, 10000]], r = 5000`\n   - Description: Darts positioned at the extreme limits of the coordinate system to evaluate how the algorithm handles large values.\n\n6. **All Darts at the Same Point**:\n   - Input: `darts = [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]], r = 1`\n   - Description: Although the problem states all darts are unique, this case tests the algorithm's handling of multiple darts at the same coordinate.\n\n7. **Darts Forming a Line**:\n   - Input: `darts = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], r = 2`\n   - Description: Darts are positioned in a straight line. This tests if the algorithm can find the optimal center to maximize coverage.\n\n8. **Darts with Negative Coordinates**:\n   - Input: `darts = [[-1, -1], [-2, -2], [-3, -3]], r = 3`\n   - Description: Darts are positioned in the negative quadrant of the coordinate system to ensure the algorithm correctly handles negative values.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, performance, and special values, ensuring a robust evaluation of the solution."

Assume changing directions does not take any additional time.\n\nWhen an ant reaches one end of the plank at a time t, it falls out of the plank immediately.\n\nGiven an integer n and two integer arrays left and right, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right, return the moment when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 4, left = [4,3], right = [0,1]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: In the image above:\n-The ant at index 0 is named A and going to the right.\n-The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right.\n-The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left.\n-The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left.\nThe last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 seconds. After that, it falls immediately out of the plank.

The expected output should be `1` since the ant will fall off immediately after 1 second.\n\n2. **All Ants Moving Left**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5, left = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], right = []`\n   - **Description**: All ants are moving to the left. The expected output is `5`, as the furthest ant takes 5 seconds to fall off.\n\n3. **All Ants Moving Right**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5, left = [], right = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`\n   - **Description**: All ants are moving to the right. The expected output is also `5`, as the furthest ant takes 5 seconds to fall off.\n\n4. **Mixed Directions with Edge Case**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 10, left = [0, 1, 2], right = [8, 9]`\n   - **Description**: Ants are positioned at both ends and the middle.

They meet and reverse directions. The expected output is `6`, as both ants will fall off after 4 seconds.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 10000, left = [0, 1, 2, ..., 9999], right = []`\n   - **Description**: Test with the maximum plank size and all ants moving left. The expected output is `10000`, as the furthest ant takes 10000 seconds to fall off.\n\n7. **Empty Left and Right Arrays**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5, left = [], right = []`\n   - **Description**: This case is invalid as per the constraints (at least one ant must be present). However, testing for proper handling of edge cases is important. The expected behavior should be to handle this gracefully, possibly by raising an error or returning a specific value.\n\n8. **Ants at Both Ends**:\n   - **Input**: `n ="

The output should be `0` since there is only one element, and no operations are needed.\n\n2. **Small Even Size Input (n = 2)**:\n   - Input: `n = 2`\n   - Description: A small even-sized array. The array will be `[1, 3]`. The output should be `1`, as one operation can equalize the two elements.\n\n3. **Small Odd Size Input (n = 3)**:\n   - Input: `n = 3`\n   - Description: An odd-sized array with three elements. The array will be `[1, 3, 5]`. The output should be `2`, as shown in the example.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Input (n = 10,000)**:\n   - Input: `n = 10000`\n   - Description: Testing the upper limit of the constraints.

This tests the algorithm's ability to handle a small array with larger gaps between numbers, ensuring it can calculate the number of operations correctly.\n\n8. **All Elements Already Equal (n = 5)**:\n   - Input: `n = 5`\n   - Description: This tests the case where the array would be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, but if we consider a scenario where all elements are already equal (e.g., `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`), the output should be `0`.

This will help assess the algorithm's efficiency and performance under upper limit constraints.\n\n5. **Arrays with Zero Values**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [0, 1], nums2 = [0, 1, 2]`\n   - Description: Test the case where one of the arrays contains zero. The expected output should be `2` since `(0, 0, 1)` and `(1, 0, 1)` are valid triplets.\n\n6. **Negative Values in Arrays**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [-1, -2], nums2 = [1, 4]`\n   - Description: Test the case where one or both arrays contain negative values. The expected output should be `0` since negative squares cannot equal positive products.\n\n7. **All Elements Resulting in Zero Products**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [0, 0], nums2 = [0, 0, 0]`\n   - Description: Test the case where all elements are zero. The expected output should be `6` since all combinations will satisfy the conditions due to the zeros.\n\n8. **Mixed Values with No Valid Triplets**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [3, 5], nums2 = [2, 4, 6]`\n   - Description: Test the case where there are no valid triplets that satisfy either condition.

This checks if the function correctly identifies that the user has no balance.\n   - **Input**: \n     ```\n     Users: [{account: 900001, name: 'Alice'}]\n     Transactions: []\n     ```\n   - **Expected Output**: `[]`\n\n3. **Single User with Transactions Below Threshold**:\n   - **Description**: A single user has transactions that result in a balance below 10,000. This ensures the function does not return users who do not meet the balance requirement.\n   - **Input**: \n     ```\n     Users: [{account: 900001, name: 'Alice'}]\n     Transactions: [{trans_id: 1, account: 900001, amount: 5000}, {trans_id: 2, account: 900001, amount: 4000}]\n     ```\n   - **Expected Output**: `[]`\n\n4. **Multiple Users with Mixed Balances**:\n   - **Description**: Multiple users exist, some with balances above 10,000 and others below.

The output should be the tower's coordinates since they all contribute to the same location.\n\n6. **Towers with Zero Quality**:\n   - **Input**: `towers = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 2, 0]], radius = 10`\n   - **Description**: Test with towers that have a quality factor of zero. The output should still be a valid coordinate, but the network quality should be zero.\n\n7. **Edge of Radius Calculation**:\n   - **Input**: `towers = [[0, 0, 10], [0, 3, 20]], radius = 3`\n   - **Description**: Test with towers positioned at the edge of the radius to ensure the distance calculation correctly includes or excludes towers based on the radius.\n\n8. **Lexicographically Minimum Coordinate**:\n   - **Input**: `towers = [[1, 1, 5], [2, 2, 5]], radius ="

This checks if the solution can handle cases where users exist but no registrations are made.\n   - **Expected Output**: An empty result set.\n\n3. **Register Table Only**:\n   - **Description**: The `Register` table has several entries, but the `Users` table is empty. This tests how the solution behaves when there are registrations without corresponding users.\n   - **Expected Output**: An empty result set.\n\n4. **Single User, Multiple Registrations**:\n   - **Description**: The `Users` table has one user, and the `Register` table has multiple entries for different contests for that user. This checks if the percentage calculation works correctly with minimal data.\n   - **Expected Output**: Each contest should show a percentage of 100.0.\n\n5. **Multiple Users, Some Registered**:\n   - **Description**: The `Users` table has multiple users, but only some of them are registered in various contests. This tests the percentage calculation when not all users are registered.\n   - **Expected Output**: The output should reflect the correct percentage based on the number of registered users divided by total users.\n\n6. **All Users Registered in One Contest**:\n   - **Description**: All users are registered in a single contest, while other contests have no registrations. This checks if the solution properly calculates 100% for the contest with all users registered.\n   - **Expected Output**: The contest with all users should show 100%, while others should show 0% or be excluded.\n\n7. **Duplicate Registrations**:\n   - **Description**: The `Register` table contains duplicate entries for the same user and contest. This tests if the solution correctly counts unique registrations.\n   - **Expected Output**: The percentage should be calculated based on unique registrations, not total entries.\n\n8. **Performance with Maximum Size**:\n   - **Description**: Both `Users` and `Register` tables contain the maximum number of entries allowed by the database (e.g., 10,000 users and 100,000 registrations). This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution under load.\n   - **Expected Output**: The output should be correctly calculated and returned within a reasonable time frame, with correct percentages for each contest.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including empty tables, single and multiple entries, duplicates, and performance considerations, which are critical for ensuring the robustness of the solution"

This tests if the algorithm can handle paths that are skewed heavily in one direction.\n\n7. **Equal Rows and Columns**:\n   - **Input**: `destination = [5, 5], k = 6`\n   - **Description**: A case where the number of rows and columns is equal, testing the algorithm's ability to generate combinations when both dimensions are the same.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case**:\n   - **Input**: `destination = [10, 5], k = 1000`\n   - **Description**: A case designed to test the performance of the algorithm with a relatively high k value and a moderate number of combinations. This checks if the algorithm can efficiently compute the k-th combination without generating all combinations explicitly.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a robust testing strategy for the problem."

The expected output should be calculated based on the tournament structure, ensuring the solution can handle the largest input efficiently.\n\n6. **Odd Number Just Below Maximum**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 199`\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance with a large odd number of teams. The expected output should be calculated and will help verify that the algorithm can handle large odd inputs correctly.\n\n7. **Even Number Just Below Maximum**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 198`\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance with a large even number of teams. The expected output should also be calculated, ensuring the algorithm handles large even inputs efficiently.\n\n8. **Power of Two**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 16`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where the number of teams is a power of two. The expected output should be `15`, as the tournament structure will allow for a straightforward pairing in each round, maximizing the number of matches played.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including minimum and maximum values, even and odd numbers, and special cases like powers of two, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution's correctness and performance."

The output should be 1 since the only rectangle can form a square of side length 5.\n\n2. **All Rectangles with Same Dimensions**:\n   - Input: `[[4, 6], [4, 6], [4, 6]]`\n   - Description: All rectangles are identical. This tests if the solution correctly counts duplicates and returns the count of rectangles that can form the largest square.\n\n3. **Maximum Size of Rectangles**:\n   - Input: `[[10^9, 10^9 - 1], [10^9 - 1, 10^9], [10^9, 10^9]]`\n   - Description: Test with rectangles at the upper limit of the constraints.

Can you clarify if the order of elements in the array matters when counting the different ways? For instance, do [2,3] and [3,2] count as separate combinations?\n\n4. What should we return if there are no valid combinations for a given query (e.g., if `ni` is larger than `ki`)? Should we return 0 or some other value?\n\n5.

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Count Ways to Make Array With Product\" problem:\n\n1. **Minimum Input Values**:\n   - **Input**: `queries = [[1, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: Test the smallest possible values for `n` and `k`. This checks if the function can handle the simplest case where the only way to fill the array is with a single element equal to 1.\n\n2. **Product of One with Larger Array**:\n   - **Input**: `queries = [[5, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case where `n` is larger than 1 but the product `k` is 1. The only valid array is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, ensuring the function correctly counts the number of ways to achieve the product of 1.\n\n3. **Maximum Size and Product**:\n   - **Input**: `queries = [[10000, 10000]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limits of the constraints. This checks if the function can handle the maximum values for both `n` and `k` without performance issues or overflow errors.\n\n4. **Prime Product with Small Array**:\n   - **Input**: `queries = [[3, 7]]`\n   - **Description**: Since 7 is prime, the only way to fill an array of size 3 to achieve a product of 7 is to use the numbers 1 and 7. This tests the function's ability to handle prime numbers effectively.\n\n5. **Product Greater than Maximum Possible Product**:\n   - **Input**: `queries = [[2, 100]]`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where `k` is greater than the maximum product possible with the given `n`. The function should return 0, as there are no valid arrays that can achieve this product.\n\n6. **Multiple Queries with Same Parameters**:\n   - **Input**: `queries = [[2, 6], [2, 6], [2, 6]]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the function's efficiency and correctness when handling duplicate queries. The output should be consistent across all identical queries.\n\n7. **Large Composite Product with Small Array**:\n   - **Input**: `queries = [[2, 12]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's ability to handle composite numbers. The valid combinations for an array of size 2 that multiply to 12 are `[3, 4]`, `[4, 3]`, `[2, 6]`, and `[6, 2]`. This checks if the function correctly identifies all combinations.\n\n8. **Performance with Maximum Number of Queries**:\n   - **Input**: `queries = [[10000, 10000]]"

        "2. **Layering Strategy**: The most efficient way to minimize the number of boxes touching the floor is to maximize the number of boxes stacked vertically. This can be achieved by utilizing the corners of the cubic room, where boxes can be stacked directly above each other.",
        "3. **Formulation**: The basic idea is to calculate how many boxes can be placed in layers. If we denote `k` as the number of layers:",
        "   - The first layer can hold up to `k^2` boxes (since boxes can be arranged in a square).",
        "   - The second layer can also hold `k^2` boxes, and so forth.",

It is guaranteed that positioni < positioni+1.\n\tspeedi is the initial speed of the ith car in meters per second.\n\n\nFor simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet.

This tests the basic functionality of the conversion and summation.\n\n2. **Base Equal to n**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5, k = 5`\n   - **Description**: When `n` is equal to the base `k`, the output should be `5` (as it is represented as `10` in base 5, and the sum of digits is `1 + 0 = 1`).\n\n3. **Base 10 with n less than 10**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 9, k = 10`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where `n` is less than the base `k` and is already in base 10. The output should be `9`.\n\n4. **Base 2 with Large n**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 100, k = 2`\n   - **Description**: Tests the conversion of a larger number into binary.

The base 3 representation of `9` is `100`, and the sum of its digits is `1`.\n\n7. **Base 6 with a non-multiple n**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 34, k = 6`\n   - **Description**: This is a standard case where `n` is not a multiple of `k`. It checks the conversion and summation logic, resulting in `9`.\n\n8. **Maximum Values**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 100, k = 10`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limits of the constraints.

This tests if the function can handle duplicates correctly.\n\n3. **Maximum Size Array with Minimum Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1] * 100000`\n   - **Description**: An array of maximum size (100,000) where all elements are the minimum value (1). This tests performance and ensures the function can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Array with Maximum Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [100000] * 100000`\n   - **Description**: An array of maximum size where all elements are the maximum value (100,000). This tests performance and checks if the function can handle large values correctly.\n\n5. **Mixed Values with Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Includes zero, which should result in specific floor division results. This tests how the function handles division by zero scenarios (though not directly applicable since zero is not in the denominator).\n\n6. **Increasing Sequence**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: A simple increasing sequence to verify that the function correctly calculates the floor division for a range of values.\n\n7. **Large Range of Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 100000]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's ability to handle the extreme ends of the input range. This checks if the function can correctly compute the floor division between the smallest and largest possible values.\n\n8. **Random Large Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5, 3, 8, 1, 6, 10, 2, 4]`\n   - **Description**: A random assortment of values to ensure the function works correctly with varied inputs and does not rely on specific patterns.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a robust evaluation of the solution's correctness and efficiency."

This tests the upper boundary condition and ensures the algorithm can handle maximum input efficiently.\n\n3. **Adjacent Players**:\n   - Input: `n = 10, firstPlayer = 4, secondPlayer = 5`\n   - Description: The two players are adjacent. This tests how the algorithm handles scenarios where the players are next to each other.\n\n4. **Players in the Middle**:\n   - Input: `n = 11, firstPlayer = 5, secondPlayer = 7`\n   - Description: Both players are in the middle of the row. This tests how the algorithm manages players that are not at the extremes.\n\n5. **First Player is Halfway**:\n   - Input: `n = 16, firstPlayer = 8, secondPlayer = 9`\n   - Description: The first player is exactly halfway in an even-sized row. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle players in the middle of the row.\n\n6. **Players Competing in the Last Round**:\n   - Input: `n = 12, firstPlayer = 3, secondPlayer = 4`\n   - Description: The players can only compete in the last round. This tests the scenario where players can only meet after several rounds.\n\n7. **Players Competing in the First Round**:\n   - Input: `n = 6, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 6`\n   - Description: The players are at opposite ends and will compete in the first round. This tests the immediate competition scenario.\n\n8. **Odd Number of Players with One Player Advancing Automatically**:\n   - Input: `n = 9, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 6`\n   - Description: Tests how the algorithm handles odd numbers of players where one player automatically advances, affecting the competition dynamics.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special arrangements of players, and performance considerations for the algorithm."

That means the first round of the day starts at 00:00 and the last round of the day starts at 23:45.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: loginTime = &quot;09:31&quot;, logoutTime = &quot;10:14&quot;\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: You played one full round from 09:45 to 10:00.\nYou did not play the full round from 09:30 to 09:45 because you logged in at 09:31 after it began.\nYou did not play the full round from 10:00 to 10:15 because you logged out at 10:14 before it ended.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: loginTime = &quot;21:30&quot;, logoutTime = &quot;03:00&quot;\nOutput: 22\nExplanation: You played 10 full rounds from 21:30 to 00:00 and 12 full rounds from 00:00 to 03:00.\n10 + 12 = 22.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tloginTime and logoutTime are in the format hh:mm.\n\t00 <= hh <= 23\n\t00 <= mm <= 59\n\tloginTime and logoutTime are not equal.\n\n"

It tests the handling of invalid inputs.\n\n2. **Logout Before Login**:\n   - **Input**: `loginTime = \"23:30\"`, `logoutTime = \"00:15\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the logout time is after midnight, ensuring the calculation correctly accounts for the rounds played before and after midnight.\n\n3. **Exact Round Start**:\n   - **Input**: `loginTime = \"10:00\"`, `logoutTime = \"10:30\"`\n   - **Description**: The login time is exactly at the start of a round. This tests whether the function correctly counts the full rounds that start after the login time.\n\n4. **Logout Just Before Round Ends**:\n   - **Input**: `loginTime = \"14:00\"`, `logoutTime = \"14:14\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the logout time is just before a round ends, ensuring that it does not count that round.\n\n5. **Login and Logout Span Multiple Rounds**:\n   - **Input**: `loginTime = \"18:00\"`, `logoutTime = \"19:00\"`\n   - **Description**: This case tests the calculation of multiple full rounds played within the span of an hour, ensuring that the function can handle multiple full rounds correctly.\n\n6. **Edge Case of Midnight**:\n   - **Input**: `loginTime = \"23:45\"`, `logoutTime = \"00:05\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the transition from one day to the next, ensuring that the function correctly counts rounds played before and after midnight.\n\n7. **Maximum Time Span**:\n   - **Input**: `loginTime = \"00:01\"`, `logoutTime = \"23:59\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the maximum possible span of time in a single day, ensuring that the function can handle the full range of time without overflow or performance issues.\n\n8. **Logout at the Last Possible Round Start**:\n   - **Input**: `loginTime = \"22:45\"`, `logoutTime = \"23:45\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the logout time is exactly at the start of the last round of the day, ensuring that the function counts all full rounds played correctly up to that point.\n\nThese edge cases cover various scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations that are critical for ensuring the robustness of the solution."

Since there are no valid triples (1^2 + 1^2 ≠ 1^2), the expected output should be `0`.\n\n2. **Small Input Value (n = 2)**:\n   - Input: `n = 2`\n   - This checks for the next smallest value. Similar to the previous case, there are no valid triples, so the expected output is `0`.\n\n3. **Small Input Value with Valid Triples (n = 5)**:\n   - Input: `n = 5`\n   - This is a known case where the valid triples are (3, 4, 5) and (4, 3, 5).

The valid triples should include (9, 12, 15) and (12, 9, 15), among others. The expected output should be calculated.\n\n8. **Input Value with No Valid Triples (n = 8)**:\n   - Input: `n = 8`\n   - This tests a case where there are no valid square triples. The expected output should be `0`, as the only combinations do not satisfy the condition \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).\n\nThese edge cases cover various scenarios, including boundary conditions, small and large inputs, and specific cases that might affect performance or correctness."

It helps verify if the function correctly identifies the perimeter for a straightforward case.\n\n3. **Small Odd Number of Apples**:\n   - **Input**: `neededApples = 13`\n   - **Description**: This tests a small odd number of apples.

The expected output is `0`.\n\n2. **Test Case 2: Single Bulb (n = 1)**\n   - Input: `n = 1`\n   - Description: This tests the scenario with the smallest non-zero number of bulbs. The expected output is `1`, as the single bulb will be on after the first round.\n\n3. **Test Case 3: Two Bulbs (n = 2)**\n   - Input: `n = 2`\n   - Description: This tests a small even number of bulbs. The expected output is `1`, as the first bulb remains on and the second bulb is turned off after the second round.\n\n4. **Test Case 4: Three Bulbs (n = 3)**\n   - Input: `n = 3`\n   - Description: This tests a small odd number of bulbs. The expected output is `1`, as described in the example, where only the first bulb remains on.\n\n5. **Test Case 5: Perfect Square (n = 16)**\n   - Input: `n = 16`\n   - Description: This tests a perfect square number. The expected output is `4`, as the bulbs that remain on correspond to the perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16).\n\n6. **Test Case 6: Large Input (n = 1,000,000)**\n   - Input: `n = 1,000,000`\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the algorithm with a large input size. The expected output is `1000`, as the number of bulbs that remain on corresponds to the integer part of the square root of `n`.\n\n7. **Test Case 7: Maximum Input (n = 1,000,000,000)**\n   - Input: `n = 1,000,000,000`\n   - Description: This tests the algorithm's ability to handle the maximum constraint.

The expected output is `6` (from `2 + 3`), which tests the algorithm's ability to find non-trivial partitions.\n\n3. **Even Number**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 8`\n   - **Description**: An even number that can be broken into equal parts. The expected output is `16` (from `4 + 4`), testing the algorithm's handling of even splits.\n\n4. **Odd Number Greater than 5**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 9`\n   - **Description**: An odd number where the optimal partition is `3 + 3 + 3`.

This tests the basic functionality of filling a single jug.\n\n2. **Target Greater than Total Capacity**: \n   - Input: `x = 2, y = 3, target = 6`\n   - Description: The target exceeds the total capacity of both jugs combined. This checks if the solution correctly identifies that it's impossible to reach the target.\n\n3. **Target Equal to One Jug's Capacity**: \n   - Input: `x = 5, y = 7, target = 5`\n   - Description: The target is equal to the capacity of one of the jugs. This tests if the solution can recognize that filling one jug is sufficient.\n\n4. **Target is a Multiple of GCD**: \n   - Input: `x = 4, y = 6, target = 2`\n   - Description: The target is a multiple of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the jug capacities. This checks if the solution correctly uses the GCD property to determine reachability.\n\n5. **Target Not a Multiple of GCD**: \n   - Input: `x = 4, y = 6, target = 3`\n   - Description: The target is not a multiple of the GCD of the jug capacities. This tests if the solution correctly identifies that the target cannot be reached.\n\n6. **Both Jugs Have Equal Capacity**: \n   - Input: `x = 5, y = 5, target = 10`\n   - Description: Both jugs have the same capacity, and the target is the sum of both jugs. This checks if the solution can handle cases where both jugs can be filled to reach the target.\n\n7. **One Jug is Empty**: \n   - Input: `x = 0, y = 5, target = 5`\n   - Description: One jug has a capacity of zero. This tests if the solution can handle cases where one jug cannot hold any water.\n\n8. **Large Values**: \n   - Input: `x = 1000, y = 1000, target = 1000`\n   - Description: Both jugs have maximum capacity, and the target is equal to one jug's capacity. This checks if the solution can handle large values efficiently without performance issues.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive test of the solution's robustness."

Expected output: `true`.\n\n2. **Small Even Heap**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 2`\n   - **Description**: The player can take 1 stone and leave 1 for the opponent, or take 2 stones and win.

        "There is a robot starting at the position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.\n\nYou are given a string moves that represents the move sequence of the robot where moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are &#39;R&#39; (right), &#39;L&#39; (left), &#39;U&#39; (up), and &#39;D&#39; (down).\n\nReturn true if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or false otherwise.\n\nNote: The way that the robot is &quot;facing&quot; is irrelevant. &#39;R&#39; will always make the robot move to the right once, &#39;L&#39; will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot&#39;s movement is the same for each move.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: moves = &quot;UD&quot;\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: moves = &quot;LL&quot;\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two &quot;moves&quot; to the left of the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its moves.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= moves.length <= 2 * 104\n\tmoves only contains the characters &#39;U&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;L&#39; and &#39;R&#39;.\n\n"

The output should be `2000000000` (to move both to `0`).\n\n8. **Array with Zero and Negative Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-3, -2, -1, 0]`\n   - **Description**: This case tests how the algorithm handles a mix of negative and zero values.

The expected output is `9`, which is the largest single-digit palindrome.\n\n2. **Small Even n (n = 2)**:\n   - Input: `n = 2`\n   - Description: This checks the case for the smallest even number of digits. The expected output is `987`, which corresponds to the product of `99` and `91`.\n\n3. **Small Odd n (n = 3)**:\n   - Input: `n = 3`\n   - Description: This tests the case for three-digit numbers. The expected output is `929`, which is the largest palindrome product of two three-digit numbers.\n\n4. **Maximum n (n = 8)**:\n   - Input: `n = 8`\n   - Description: This tests the upper limit of `n`. The expected output should be calculated based on the largest product of two 8-digit numbers, which is expected to be a large palindrome.\n\n5. **Performance Case (n = 7)**:\n   - Input: `n = 7`\n   - Description: This case checks the performance of the algorithm with a relatively high value of `n` without reaching the maximum. It ensures that the solution can handle larger computations efficiently.\n\n6. **Palindromic Products with Leading Zeros**:\n   - Input: `n = 2` (considering numbers like `10` and `11`)\n   - Description: This tests how the algorithm handles products that may involve leading zeros in the context of palindromes. The expected output should still be valid palindromic products.\n\n7. **Edge Case for Modulo Operation**:\n   - Input: `n = 4` (where the product of two 4-digit numbers is very large)\n   - Description: This checks if the algorithm correctly applies the modulo operation when the largest palindrome product exceeds `1337`. The output should be the result of the palindrome product modulo `1337`.\n\n8. **Identical Digits Case (n = 5)**:\n   - Input: `n = 5`\n   - Description: This tests the scenario where both numbers are the same (e.g., `99999 * 99999`). It ensures that the algorithm can handle cases where the maximum product is a palindrome itself.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, performance considerations, and special cases related to the problem domain."

The expected output should be `[13, 1]`, as the only factors are 1 and 13.\n\n4. **Large Area (10^7)**:\n   - Input: `area = 10^7`\n   - Description: This tests the upper boundary condition for the maximum allowed area. The expected output should be `[3162, 3162]`, as the largest factors close to the square root of 10^7.\n\n5. **Even Area with Two Factors (36)**:\n   - Input: `area = 36`\n   - Description: This tests a case where the area has multiple pairs of factors. The expected output should be `[6, 6]`, as this is the optimal pair with the smallest difference.\n\n6. **Area with Multiple Factor Pairs (30)**:\n   - Input: `area = 30`\n   - Description: This tests a case with several factor pairs. The expected output should be `[6, 5]`, as this pair minimizes the difference between length and width.\n\n7. **Area Just Above a Perfect Square (20)**:\n   - Input: `area = 20`\n   - Description: This tests a case where the area is just above a perfect square. The expected output should be `[5, 4]`, as this is the optimal configuration.\n\n8. **Area with Large Difference Between Factors (50)**:\n   - Input: `area = 50`\n   - Description: This tests a case where the factors have a significant difference. The expected output should be `[10, 5]`, as this pair minimizes the difference while satisfying the area requirement.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the solution."

It should return `false`.\n\n4. **Large Perfect Number**:\n   - Input: `28`\n   - Description: A well-known perfect number.

The sum of its divisors (1) does not equal 29, so it should return `false`. \n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including minimum and maximum values, known perfect numbers, non-perfect numbers, and edge cases related to the properties of numbers."

The output should be \"10/2\".\n\n3. **Maximum Size Case**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1000, 999, 998, 997, 996, 995, 994, 993, 992, 991]`\n   - **Description**: Testing the upper limit of the input size (10 elements). This will help ensure the algorithm handles the maximum input size efficiently.\n\n4. **All Elements Same**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [10, 10, 10, 10]`\n   - **Description**: All elements are the same.

It should return `0` since no moves are needed.\n\n2. **All Machines Empty**\n   - **Input:** `machines = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description:** All machines are empty. The output should be `0` since they are already equal.\n\n3. **All Machines with Same Number of Dresses**\n   - **Input:** `machines = [2, 2, 2, 2]`\n   - **Description:** All machines have the same number of dresses. The output should be `0` as no moves are needed.\n\n4. **Impossible Case with Excess Dresses**\n   - **Input:** `machines = [0, 3, 0]`\n   - **Description:** This case is similar to Example 2, but it emphasizes the impossibility of equal distribution. The output should be `-1`.\n\n5. **Large Number of Dresses in One Machine**\n   - **Input:** `machines = [0, 100000, 0]`\n   - **Description:** Test the case where one machine has a very large number of dresses. The output should be a large number of moves, testing the algorithm's ability to handle large inputs.\n\n6. **Maximum Size with Uniform Distribution**\n   - **Input:** `machines = [100000] * 10000`\n   - **Description:** Test the upper limit of the input size with all machines having the same number of dresses. The output should be `0`.\n\n7. **Large Number of Machines with Varying Dresses**\n   - **Input:** `machines = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n   - **Description:** A case with a large number of machines and a gradual increase in the number of dresses. This tests the algorithm's efficiency in calculating the moves needed.\n\n8. **Edge Case with Duplicates and Zeroes**\n   - **Input:** `machines = [0, 2, 2, 0]`\n   - **Description:** This case has duplicates and zeroes, testing if the algorithm can handle distributions that require balancing between machines with zero dresses and those with more. The output should be `2`.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of edge cases, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations to ensure the solution is robust and efficient."
