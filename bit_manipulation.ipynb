Its binary representation is `1`, which has no adjacent 1's. Expected output is `0`.\n\n2. **Single Adjacent Pair**: \n   - **Input**: `3`\n   - **Description**: The binary representation is `11`. This case tests the simplest scenario where there are two adjacent 1's. Expected output is `0` (distance between them is 0).\n\n3. **Multiple Gaps with Different Distances**: \n   - **Input**: `22`\n   - **Description**: As given in the example, the binary representation is `10110`. It has two pairs of adjacent 1's with distances 2 and 1. Expected output is `2`.\n\n4. **No Adjacent 1's**: \n   - **Input**: `8`\n   - **Description**: The binary representation is `1000`. This tests the case where there are no adjacent 1's. Expected output is `0`.\n\n5. **Large Input Value with Adjacent 1's**: \n   - **Input**: `1073741825` (which is `10000000000000000000000000000001` in binary)\n   - **Description**: This tests the upper limit of the input constraint (1 <= n <= 10^9). The binary representation has only two 1's at the ends, so the expected output is `30`.\n\n6. **Multiple Adjacent 1's**: \n   - **Input**: `14`\n   - **Description**: The binary representation is `1110`. This tests the case where there are three adjacent 1's. The expected output is `1` (the distance between the first and second 1).\n\n7. **Alternating 1's and 0's**: \n   - **Input**: `21`\n   - **Description**: The binary representation is `10101`. This tests the case where there are multiple 1's but they are not adjacent. Expected output is `2` (distance between the first and third 1).\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case with Maximum Value**: \n   - **Input**: `1_000_000_000` (which is `111011100110101100101000000000` in binary)\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance of the solution at the maximum input size. It has multiple 1's with varying distances. The expected output should be calculated based on the binary representation.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including minimum and maximum values, edge cases with no adjacent 1's, and varying distances between 1's."

However, since the constraints allow for up to `50,000` elements, this would be inefficient.",

The output should be `0` since a single number cannot form a valid triple.\n\n2. **All Zeros**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description**: All elements are zero. This should return `27` since any combination of indices will yield a bitwise AND of zero.\n\n3. **Single Non-Zero Element**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where there is one non-zero element. The output should be `0` since a single number cannot form a valid triple.\n\n4. **All Elements Same**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [7, 7, 7]`\n   - **Description**: All elements are the same non-zero number. The output should be `0` because the AND of the same number will never be zero.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0] * 1000` (1000 zeros)\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the input size. The output should be `27` since all combinations will yield zero.\n\n6. **Mixed Values with Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a small array with a zero and other numbers. The output should be `36` since combinations involving zero will yield valid triples.\n\n7. **Large Range of Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with powers of two. The output should be `0` since no combination of these numbers will yield a bitwise AND of zero.\n\n8. **Duplicates with Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 1, 1, 2]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with duplicates and a zero. The output should be `36` as there are multiple combinations that yield a bitwise AND of zero.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios including edge cases related to input size, special values, and performance considerations."

The expected output is `[0, 1]`, which checks if the function can handle the simplest case.\n\n2. **Single Element Permutation**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 1, start = 1`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case where `start` is the maximum value for `n = 1`. The expected output is `[1, 0]`, ensuring the function can handle the maximum start value correctly.\n\n3. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 16, start = 0`\n   - **Description**: This tests the upper limit of `n`, which results in a permutation of size `2^16 = 65536`. This checks the performance and memory handling of the function with large inputs.\n\n4. **Start at Maximum Value**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 16, start = 65535`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case where `start` is the maximum possible value for `n = 16`. The expected output should still form a valid circular permutation, ensuring the function handles edge values correctly.\n\n5. **Start in the Middle**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 4, start = 8`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where `start` is in the middle of the range (0 to 15). The expected output should be a valid permutation starting from 8, ensuring the function can generate permutations from arbitrary starting points.\n\n6. **Adjacent Bit Difference**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 3, start = 1`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case where the starting point is `1`, which is `001` in binary. The expected output should be a valid circular permutation that starts with `1` and adheres to the one-bit difference rule.\n\n7. **All Zeroes**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 2, start = 0`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case where `start` is `0`. The expected output should be `[0, 1, 3, 2]`, ensuring that the function can handle permutations starting from zero.\n\n8. **Performance with Random Start**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 10, start = 512`\n   - **Description**: This tests a case with a moderate size of `n` and a random starting point. The expected output should still form a valid circular permutation, ensuring the function performs well with non-trivial inputs"

The expected output should be `0` since it's impossible to select three indices.\n\n3. **All Elements are Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where all elements are zero. The expected output should be `10` since any triplet will satisfy the condition `a == b`.\n\n4. **All Elements are the Same**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [5, 5, 5, 5]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where all elements are the same non-zero value. The expected output should be `10`, as all combinations will yield the same XOR.\n\n5. **Maximum Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 3, ..., 300]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the input size (300 elements).

The expected output should be calculated based on the specific XOR values.\n\n7. **Duplicates with Mixed Values**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with duplicates and mixed values. This checks if the solution correctly identifies valid triplets despite the presence of duplicates.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case with Large Values**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [10^8, 10^8, 10^8]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the handling of large integer values in the array. The expected output should be `1` since there's only one valid triplet `(0, 1, 2)`.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of edge conditions, including minimum and maximum input sizes, special values, and performance considerations."

It should return 0 since no operations are needed.\n\n2. **Single Element Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0]`\n   - **Description**: This checks how the function handles the case where the target is zero. The output should be 0 as no operations are needed to convert an array of zeros to another zero.\n\n3. **Single Element Non-Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the function with a single non-zero element. The expected output should be 5, as it requires 5 increment operations to reach 5 from 0.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1] * 10^5` (an array of 100,000 elements, all set to 1)\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance of the function with the maximum allowed size. The expected output should be 100,000, as each element will need to be incremented individually.\n\n5. **Maximum Value Element**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [10^9]`\n   - **Description**: This checks how the function handles the maximum possible value for an element. The expected output should be 1 billion, as it requires 1 billion increment operations to reach 10^9 from 0.\n\n6. **All Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [3, 3, 3, 3]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the function with all elements being the same. The expected output should be 12, as it would require 3 increments for each of the 4 elements.\n\n7. **Mixed Values with Powers of Two**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the function with values that are powers of two. The expected output should be calculated based on the optimal strategy of doubling and incrementing.\n\n8. **Large Gaps Between Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 1000000000]`\n   - **Description**: This tests how the function handles large differences between elements. The expected output should reflect the combination of incrementing the first element and then doubling to reach the second element.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, maximum constraints, and special values that could affect the performance and correctness of the solution."

Is there a specific range for the values of `k` in relation to the length of `nums`, or can `k` be equal to the length of `nums`? For example, if `k` is equal to `nums.length`, should the entire array be modified to achieve the desired result?\n\n4. Are there any performance constraints we should be aware of, considering the maximum length of `nums` is 2000? Should we aim for a specific time complexity, such as O(n) or O(n log n)?\n\n5.

The output should be `0`.\n\n3. **Small Range with Consecutive Numbers**: \n   - Input: `left = 3, right = 5`\n   - Description: A small range where the AND operation will yield a non-zero result. This tests the basic functionality of the AND operation across a small set.\n\n4. **Power of Two Range**: \n   - Input: `left = 8, right = 15`\n   - Description: This range includes numbers that are both below and above a power of two.

The output should be `31`.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case**: \n   - Input: `left = 1, right = 1000000000`\n   - Description: A large range to test the performance of the algorithm.

Is it guaranteed that the input array will always contain exactly one unique element, or should we handle cases where there might be no unique element or multiple unique elements?\n\n4. Should the solution handle large arrays efficiently, and are there any specific performance benchmarks we need to meet beyond the linear runtime and constant space requirements?\n\n5. Are there any specific requirements for the output format, such as whether the output should be printed or returned in a particular way?"

        "Here are 8 important edge cases to consider for the \"Single Number\" problem:\n\n1. **Single Element (Minimum Size)**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the smallest possible input size, where the array contains only one element. This checks if the function can handle the minimum constraint.\n\n2. **All Positive Numbers**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where the single number is the largest positive number in the array. This checks if the function correctly identifies the unique number among positive duplicates.\n\n3. **All Negative Numbers**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-1, -1, -2, -2, -3]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where the single number is negative. This checks if the function can handle negative values correctly.\n\n4. **Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, -1, 2, -2, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the function can differentiate between them and identify the unique number.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [i for i in range(-30000, 30000) if i != 0] + [0]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function with the maximum allowed size of the input array (30,000 elements). This checks the performance and efficiency of the solution.\n\n6. **Zero as the Unique Number**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where the unique number is zero. This checks if the function can correctly identify zero as the single number.\n\n7. **Duplicates with Large Range**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [10000, 10000, 20000, 20000, 30000]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with large positive integers to ensure that the function can handle large values correctly.\n\n8. **Performance with Alternating Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where the duplicates are interleaved with the unique number. This checks if the function can correctly identify the single number in a non-sequential arrangement.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive test of the solution's robustness."
