        "To solve the problem of regular expression matching with support for `.` and `*`, we can use dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to create a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` will be `True` if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`. \n",

        "Here's a step-by-step outline of the approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - Create a 2D list `dp` of size `(len(s) + 1) x (len(p) + 1)` initialized to `False`.\n",
        "   - The base case is `dp[0][0] = True`, meaning two empty strings match.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - Iterate through each character in the pattern `p`.\n",
        "   - If `p[j-1]` is `*`, we can either ignore the preceding character or use it:\n",
        "     - `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]` (ignoring the `*` and the preceding character).\n",
        "     - If `s[i-1]` matches `p[j-2]`, then we can extend it: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.\n",
        "   - If `p[j-1]` is `.` or matches `s[i-1]`, we have:\n",
        "     - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` (check the previous characters).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Result**:\n",
        "   - The answer will be found in `dp[len(s)][len(p)]`.\n",

        "1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if the entire input string `s` matches the pattern `p`, where:\n",
        "   - `?` matches any single character.\n",
        "   - `*` matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will create a 2D boolean DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `dp[0][0]` is `True` because an empty string matches an empty pattern.\n",
        "   - If the pattern starts with `*`, it can match an empty string, so we initialize the first row accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - Iterate through each character in `s` and `p`.\n",
        "   - If characters match or if there's a `?`, we carry over the match from the previous state.\n",
        "   - If we encounter a `*`, it can either:\n",
        "     - Match zero characters (look at the state directly above).\n",
        "     - Match one or more characters (look at the state to the left).\n",

        "\n",
        "### Explanation of the Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Grid**: The robot can only move either right or down. This means that to reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner, the robot must make exactly \\( (m-1) \\) moves down and \\( (n-1) \\) moves right. Therefore, the total moves required are \\( (m-1) + (n-1) = m + n - 2 \\).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Base Case**: The number of ways to reach the first row and the first column is 1, because there is only one way to move right across the first row and one way to move down the first column.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filling the DP Table**: For each cell `(i, j)`, the number of unique paths to reach that cell is the sum of the paths to the cell directly above it `(i-1, j)` and the cell directly to the left of it `(i, j-1)`. This is because the robot can only come from those two cells.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding BST Structure**:\n",
        "   - In a BST, for any node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater.\n",
        "   - When choosing a root for the BST from the values `1` to `n`, if we select a value `i` as the root, the left subtree will contain values from `1` to `i-1` (which will have `i-1` nodes) and the right subtree will contain values from `i+1` to `n` (which will have `n-i` nodes).\n",
        "\n",

        "   - If `i` is chosen as the root, the number of unique BSTs that can be formed is the product of the number of unique BSTs that can be formed from the left subtree and the right subtree:\n",
        "     - Left Subtree: `count(i-1)`\n",
        "     - Right Subtree: `count(n-i)`\n",

        "   - Here, `C(k)` is the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `k` nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Programming**:\n",
        "   - We can use a dynamic programming approach to build up the number of unique BSTs for all values from `0` to `n`, storing results in an array `dp`.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Steps:\n",

        "   - Set up two arrays `lengths` and `counts`, both of the same length as `nums`.\n",
        "   - Initialize each position in `lengths` to 1 because the shortest increasing subsequence ending at any element is the element itself.\n",
        "   - Initialize each position in `counts` to 1 because there is at least one subsequence (the element itself) for each position.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:\n",
        "   - For each element at index `i`, check all previous elements (from index `0` to `i-1`).\n",
        "   - If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, then `i` can extend the increasing subsequence that ends at `j`.\n",
        "     - If `lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]`, it means we found a longer subsequence ending at `i`, so we update `lengths[i]` and reset `counts[i]` to `counts[j]`.\n",
        "     - If `lengths[j] + 1 == lengths[i]`, it means we found another way to form the same length of subsequence, so we add `counts[j]` to `counts[i]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Extract the Result**:\n",
        "   - Find the maximum value in `lengths` to determine the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n",
        "   - Sum up all values in `counts` where the corresponding `lengths` value is equal to the maximum length to get the total number of longest increasing subsequences.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**\n",
        "1. **State Definition:** We define a 3D DP array `dp[moves][r][c]` where:\n",
        "   - `moves` represents the number of moves made so far.\n",
        "   - `r` is the row index of the knight's current position.\n",
        "   - `c` is the column index of the knight's current position.\n",
        "   - The value at `dp[moves][r][c]` will represent the probability of the knight being at position `(r, c)` after `moves` moves.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Base Case:** When `moves = 0`, the knight is definitely at the starting position `(row, column)`, so:\n",
        "   - `dp[0][row][column] = 1.0` (probability of being at the starting position without moving is 100%).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transitions:** For each possible position `(r, c)` and for every move, we calculate the probabilities for the next moves. A knight can move to 8 possible positions:\n",
        "   - `(r + 2, c + 1)`, `(r + 2, c - 1)`, `(r - 2, c + 1)`, `(r - 2, c - 1)`\n",
        "   - `(r + 1, c + 2)`, `(r + 1, c - 2)`, `(r - 1, c + 2)`, `(r - 1, c - 2)`\n",
        "   \n",
        "   For each valid position `(nr, nc)` that the knight can move to, we update the DP table:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   dp[moves + 1][nr][nc] += dp[moves][r][c] / 8\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   This distributes the current probability of being at `(r, c)` evenly among the 8 possible moves.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Calculation:** After processing all `k` moves, the total probability of the knight remaining on the board is the sum of all probabilities in `dp[k][r][c]` where `(r, c)` are valid positions within the board.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "To solve the problem of maximizing profit from buying and selling stock with a transaction fee, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The key idea is to keep track of two states:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cash**: The maximum profit we can have when we do not own any stock.\n",
        "2. **Hold**: The maximum profit we can have when we own a stock.\n",
        "\n",
        "At each day, we have the option to either:\n",
        "- Sell the stock (if we hold one), which would add the price of the stock minus the transaction fee to our cash.\n",
        "- Buy a stock (if we do not hold one), which would decrease our cash by the price of the stock.\n",
        "- Do nothing, which keeps our current state unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "The transitions between these states can be defined as follows:\n",
        "- If we hold a stock on day `i`, we can either:\n",
        "  - Stay in the hold state from the previous day: `hold[i] = hold[i-1]`\n",
        "  - Buy a stock today (which means we were in cash state yesterday and we pay the current price): `hold[i] = max(hold[i], cash[i-1] - prices[i])`\n",
        "  \n",
        "- If we do not hold any stock on day `i`, we can either:\n",
        "  - Stay in the cash state from the previous day: `cash[i] = cash[i-1]`\n",
        "  - Sell the stock we hold today (which means we transition from the hold state and pay the transaction fee): `cash[i] = max(cash[i], hold[i-1] + prices[i] - fee)`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Initial Conditions:\n",
        "- On day 0, if we do not hold any stock, our profit is 0: `cash[0] = 0`\n",
        "- If we hold a stock on day 0, we cannot have any profit, so we can treat it as negative infinity: `hold[0] = -prices[0]`\n",

        "The problem can be likened to the \"House Robber\" problem, where you cannot rob two adjacent houses. Here, if you choose to earn points by removing a number `x`, you cannot earn points from `x-1` or `x+1` due to the constraints provided. \n",
        "\n",
        "To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Count Points:** First, count how many points we can earn from each number. We can use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to tally how many times each number appears in the input list.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup:** We will set up a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points we can earn by considering numbers from `0` to `i`. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **DP Transition:** The recurrence relation will be:\n",
        "   - If we choose to delete all instances of `i`, we earn `i * count[i]` points, and we add it to the maximum points earned from deleting up to `i-2` (since `i-1` cannot be included).\n",
        "   - If we skip deleting `i`, then we simply take the maximum points earned up to `i-1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   So the relation can be defined as:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + i * count[i])\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",

        "We will use a 3D dynamic programming (DP) table to keep track of the maximum cherries that can be collected. The key steps of the solution are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define the DP State**:\n",
        "   - Let `dp[r1][c1][r2]` be the maximum number of cherries collected when we reach (r1, c1) on the way down and (r2, c2) on the way back, where:\n",
        "     - `(r1, c1)` is the coordinate on the way down.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Base Case**:\n",
        "   - If either `(r1, c1)` or `(r2, c2)` is outside the grid or is a thorn (-1), we cannot proceed, and the result is 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transition**:\n",
        "   - For each valid position `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`, we need to consider moving to the next positions (down or right for the first trip and up or left for the return trip). We will accumulate the cherries collected based on the conditions.\n",

        "\n",
        "To solve the \"Min Cost Climbing Stairs\" problem, we can utilize a dynamic programming (DP) approach. The idea is to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each step in the staircase until we reach the top.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the plan:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Define a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum cost to reach step `i`.\n",
        "2. **Base Cases**:\n",
        "   - The cost of reaching the first step (`dp[0]`) is simply `cost[0]`.\n",
        "   - The cost of reaching the second step (`dp[1]`) is the minimum of starting from step 0 or directly from step 1: `dp[1] = min(cost[0], cost[1])`.\n",
        "3. **Recurrence Relation**: For each subsequent step starting from index 2, the minimum cost to reach that step can be calculated as:\n",
        "   - `dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])`\n",
        "   This means that to reach step `i`, you can either come from step `i-1` or step `i-2`, and you add the cost of the current step to the minimum of the two previous costs.\n",
        "4. **Result**: The result will be the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase, which can be obtained from the last two entries in the `dp` array, as you can either step directly from the last step or the one before it.\n",

        "To solve the \"New 21 Game\" problem, we can leverage dynamic programming to calculate the probability that Alice ends up with `n` or fewer points after drawing cards. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**: \n",
        "   - Alice starts at 0 points and draws until she reaches at least `k` points.\n",
        "   - Each draw gives her a random integer between `1` and `maxPts` (inclusive).\n",
        "   - We need to calculate the probability that after drawing, Alice has `n` or fewer points.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Array**:\n",
        "   - We maintain a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the probability of having exactly `i` points after drawing cards.\n",
        "   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `1` because there is a 100% probability that Alice starts with 0 points.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transition**:\n",
        "   - For each point `i` from `1` to `n`, calculate `dp[i]` as the sum of probabilities from previous points that could lead to `i`. Specifically, for each possible card draw from `1` to `maxPts`, we can derive:\n",
        "     - `dp[i] += dp[i - j]` for `j` from `1` to `maxPts` (only if `i - j >= 0`).\n",
        "   - To efficiently compute the sum of probabilities from previous draws, maintain a sliding window sum to avoid recalculating sums repeatedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Stopping Condition**:\n",
        "   - If Alice's score reaches at least `k`, we stop drawing and just care about scores from `0` to `n` which can be derived directly from the last computed probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Probability Calculation**:\n",
        "   - The final result is the sum of probabilities from `dp[0]` to `dp[n]` (for scores `0` to `n`).\n",

        "#### Steps to Build the Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Base Cases**:\n",
        "   - When there is only one egg (`k = 1`), the only way to find \\( f \\) is to drop the egg from each floor starting from 1 up to \\( n \\). Thus, `dp[1][n] = n`.\n",
        "   - When there are zero floors (`n = 0`), no moves are needed, so `dp[k][0] = 0` for any \\( k \\).\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Recursive Relation**:\n",
        "   - For more than one egg and more than one floor, we drop an egg from a floor \\( x \\):\n",
        "     - If it breaks, we need to check the floors below \\( x \\) with one less egg (`dp[k-1][x-1]`).\n",
        "     - If it doesn't break, we need to check the floors above \\( x \\) with the same number of eggs (`dp[k][n-x]`).\n",
        "   - Therefore, the relation can be expressed as:\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     dp[k][n] = 1 + \\min_{1 \\leq x \\leq n}(\\max(dp[k-1][x-1], dp[k][n-x]))\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "   - The `1 +` accounts for the current drop.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimization**:\n",
        "   - Instead of checking every floor \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( n \\), we can use a binary search approach to minimize our calculations because the maximum of the two terms will first increase and then decrease.\n",

        "To solve the problem of counting valid permutations based on the given \"I\" (increasing) and \"D\" (decreasing) sequence, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to define a DP table that tracks the number of valid permutations for subproblems defined by the length of the input string and the last character in the permutation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: \n",
        "   - Define a DP table (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` will represent the number of valid permutations of the first `i` characters of `s` that end with the number `j`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Base Case**:\n",
        "   - For the first character, there is only one way to create a permutation of size 1 (just the number 0). Thus, initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - Iterate over each character in the string `s` and the possible last numbers in the permutation.\n",
        "   - For each \"I\" at position `i`, if the last number is `j`, then the previous number can be any number less than `j` (ensuring an increasing sequence).\n",
        "   - For each \"D\" at position `i`, if the last number is `j`, then the previous number can be any number greater than `j` (ensuring a decreasing sequence).\n",
        "   - Use nested loops to fill the DP table based on the current character in `s`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Result Calculation**:\n",
        "   - Sum up all valid permutations for the last character of the string `s` across all possible last numbers.\n",

        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Falling Path:**\n",
        "   - A falling path starts from any element in the first row and can move to the next row by either going directly down or diagonally left or right. \n",
        "   - This means from a position `(row, col)`, the next possible positions are `(row + 1, col - 1)`, `(row + 1, col)`, and `(row + 1, col + 1)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction:**\n",
        "   - We can modify the original `matrix` to serve as our DP table. This means we will iterate from the second last row up to the first row and for each element, update it to the minimum falling path sum using the available positions below it.\n",
        "   - The value of `matrix[i][j]` will be updated to include the minimum sum of the falling path that can reach that position.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - Begin from the second last row and for each element, compute the minimum sum of the falling path by checking the three possible positions in the row below.\n",
        "   \n",

        "\n",
        "To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of columns to delete so that each string in the array is in lexicographic order, we can use a dynamic programming approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: A string is in lexicographic order if each character is less than or equal to the next character. For example, \"abc\" is in order, but \"cba\" is not.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We can use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that the first `i` strings (from index 0 to i) are in lexicographic order.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Iterate Over Columns**: For each column `j` in the strings, we check if the strings can be sorted when columns up to `j` are deleted. We will keep track of the last column index that was valid for maintaining the lexicographic order.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Updating the DP Array**: For each string, if it is not in order with respect to the previous string, we add to the deletions required. The main idea is to check all pairs of strings and determine if they are in the required order. If not, we increment our deletion count.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "You are given an integer array `arr` and need to determine how many starting indices can lead to the end of the array by making a series of jumps. The jumps are categorized into odd-numbered and even-numbered jumps with specific criteria for each type:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Odd-numbered jumps** (1st, 3rd, ...) can only move to the smallest index `j` where `arr[j]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`.\n",
        "- **Even-numbered jumps** (2nd, 4th, ...) can only move to the smallest index `j` where `arr[j]` is less than or equal to `arr[i]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "A starting index is considered \"good\" if you can reach the last index of the array through these jumps.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**: Create two boolean arrays:\n",
        "   - `odd_jump[i]`: True if starting from index `i`, you can reach the end using odd-numbered jumps.\n",
        "   - `even_jump[i]`: True if starting from index `i`, you can reach the end using even-numbered jumps.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - The last index is always a good starting point because you are already at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sorting for Jumps**:\n",
        "   - For odd jumps, sort the indices based on the values in `arr`. When values are equal, sort by index to ensure we can jump to the smallest index.\n",
        "   - For even jumps, sort similarly but in reverse order, as we want to find the largest valid index.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filling the DP Arrays**:\n",
        "   - Traverse the sorted indices and update the `odd_jump` and `even_jump` arrays based on the criteria defined.\n",

        "\n",
        "To solve the \"Minimum Cost For Tickets\" problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover all travel days up to the `i-th` day in the `days` array.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: Initialize a `dp` array of size `len(days) + 1` where `dp[0]` is `0` (no cost for zero days) and the rest of the entries are set to infinity (or a large number initially) since we want to find the minimum cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterate Over the Days**: For each day in `days`, compute the minimum cost for that day considering the three different types of tickets:\n",
        "   - **1-Day Pass**: If you buy a 1-day pass on that day, add the cost of the pass to the total cost incurred until the previous day.\n",
        "   - **7-Day Pass**: To account for a 7-day pass, find the last day that is covered by this pass and compute the cost accordingly.\n",
        "   - **30-Day Pass**: Similarly, for a 30-day pass, find the last day covered by this pass.\n",

        "\n",
        "To solve the problem of finding the longest arithmetic subsequence in an array, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. The key idea is to maintain a dictionary of lengths of arithmetic subsequences for each pair of elements in the array, based on their differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding Arithmetic Subsequences**: An arithmetic subsequence has a constant difference between consecutive elements. For example, in the sequence [3, 6, 9, 12], the common difference is 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will use a dictionary (`dp`) where `dp[j][d]` represents the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending with `nums[j]` that has a common difference of `d`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Iterate Over Pairs**: For every pair of indices `(i, j)` where `i < j`, calculate the difference `d = nums[j] - nums[i]`. Use this difference to update our `dp` table:\n",
        "   - If there is already a subsequence with that difference ending at `i`, we can extend it by including `nums[j]`.\n",
        "   - If not, we can start a new subsequence with these two elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Keep Track of the Maximum Length**: As we update the `dp` table, we maintain a variable to keep track of the maximum length of any arithmetic subsequence found.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**: The final answer will be the maximum length found in the `dp` table.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting the Words**: \n",

        "2. **Dynamic Programming Array**:\n",
        "   - We maintain a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain that ends with the word at index `i`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Checking Predecessors**:\n",
        "   - For each word in the sorted list, we check all possible predecessors by removing one character at a time and checking if the resulting word exists in our list of words (using a set for quick lookups).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Updating the DP Array**:\n",
        "   - If a predecessor is found, we update the DP value for the current word based on the predecessor's DP value.\n",

        "5. **Result Calculation**:\n",

        "\n",
        "To find the shortest common supersequence (SCS) of two strings `str1` and `str2`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The key points of the approach are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: The SCS can be constructed by first determining the Longest Common Subsequence of the two strings. The LCS helps to identify which characters can be shared between the two strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We create a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` will store the length of the LCS of the prefixes `str1[0:i]` and `str2[0:j]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - If the characters match (`str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]`), we can say `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.\n",
        "   - If they do not match, we take the maximum from either string: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Constructing the SCS**: Once we have the LCS length, we can backtrack through the DP table to construct the SCS. We start from the bottom-right of the DP table and move to the top-left, building the result string by adding characters from both strings according to the LCS.\n",

        "The problem of filling bookcase shelves can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the minimum height required for the books placed on the shelves as we iterate through the list of books.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Update DP Array**: For each book, we'll check if it can fit on the current shelf. If it fits, we continue adding books until we can no longer fit more on that shelf or until we reach the end of the books. If it doesn't fit, we start a new shelf, and we update the DP array accordingly.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**:\n",
        "   - Each node in the binary tree can either be a leaf (which corresponds to an element in `arr`) or a non-leaf node (which represents the product of the largest values from its left and right subtrees).\n",
        "   - The goal is to minimize the sum of the values of the non-leaf nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:\n",
        "   - We will create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` will store the minimum cost to form a binary tree using the elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`.\n",
        "   - If `i == j`, then `dp[i][j]` is simply `0` because a single leaf node has no non-leaf nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calculating Costs**:\n",
        "   - For each possible subtree defined by a range `(i, j)`, we will try each possible position `k` as a split point where the left subtree is from `i` to `k` and the right subtree is from `k+1` to `j`.\n",
        "   - The value of the non-leaf node formed by these two subtrees is determined by the maximum leaf values in the subtrees (which can be computed using a precomputed array of maximum values).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterating Through Subtrees**:\n",
        "   - We iterate over all possible lengths of subtrees and calculate the minimum cost for each subtree by evaluating all possible splits.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Result**:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding Borders**: A square subgrid of size `k` is considered bordered by 1s if all cells in the top row, bottom row, left column, and right column of that square are 1s.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We can create a 2D list (or table) `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the size of the largest bordered square whose bottom-right corner is at position `(i, j)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - For each cell in the grid, if it is `1`, we need to check the minimum size of bordered squares that can be formed with that cell as the bottom-right corner.\n",
        "   - The square's size will depend on the smallest size of valid squares that can be formed from the top, left, and the top-left diagonal positions.\n",
        "   - Specifically, if we can form a square of size `k`, then we need to ensure that:\n",
        "     - The top row (from `(i-k+1, j-k+1)` to `(i-k+1, j)`) has all 1s.\n",
        "     - The left column (from `(i-k+1, j-k+1)` to `(i, j-k+1)`) has all 1s.\n",

        "   - **Input**: `piles = [4, 4, 4, 4]`\n",
        "   - **Description**: Tests how the algorithm handles cases where all piles have the same number of stones. The optimal strategy should still yield the correct maximum for Alice.\n",

        "   - **Input**: `piles = [1, 2, 3, ..., 100]` (an array of size 100 with increasing values)\n",
        "   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the input size to ensure the algorithm performs efficiently with the maximum constraints.\n",

        "   - **Input**: `piles = [10000, 10000, 10000, 10000]`\n",
        "   - **Description**: Tests the algorithm's ability to handle large stone values. This checks for potential overflow issues or performance degradation.\n",

        "The problem at hand is to find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings. A common subsequence is a sequence that appears in both strings in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Dynamic Programming Steps:**\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D array `dp` of size (m+1) x (n+1) where `m` is the length of `text1` and `n` is the length of `text2`. The first row and the first column will be initialized to 0 since the LCS of an empty string with any string is 0.\n",

        "2. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - Iterate through each character of `text1` and `text2`.\n",

        "To solve the problem of finding the longest arithmetic subsequence with a given difference, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain a dictionary that keeps track of the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence that ends with each number in the given array `arr`.\n",

        "Here's the step-by-step approach:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Iterate through the Array**: For each number in the array, we check if there's a previous number that can form an arithmetic sequence with the current number. Specifically, we check if `current_number - difference` exists in our `dp` dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Update the Dictionary**: If it exists, it means we can extend the subsequence ending at `current_number - difference` by including the current number. Thus, we can set:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   dp[current_number] = dp[current_number - difference] + 1\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   If it doesn't exist, we can start a new subsequence with just the current number:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   dp[current_number] = 1\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Track the Maximum Length**: Throughout the iterations, we keep track of the maximum length of any subsequence found.\n",

        "To solve the \"Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling\" problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with binary search. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Explanation of the Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Job Representation**: We first represent each job as a tuple of `(startTime, endTime, profit)`. This will allow us to easily manage and sort the jobs based on their end times.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sorting**: We sort the jobs based on their end times. This helps in efficiently finding the latest job that doesn't overlap with the current job we are considering.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We maintain a DP array where `dp[i]` will store the maximum profit that can be obtained by considering the first `i` jobs. The idea is to decide for each job whether to include it in our schedule or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Jobs**: For each job, we can use binary search to find the last job that ends before the current job starts. This allows us to efficiently find the maximum profit obtainable from jobs that do not overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Recurrence Relation**:\n",
        "   - If we take the current job, the profit will be the profit of the current job plus the maximum profit from the last non-overlapping job.\n",
        "   - If we skip the current job, the profit will be the maximum profit from the previous jobs.\n",
        "   - Thus, the relation becomes:\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     dp[i] = \\max(dp[i-1], profit[i] + dp[prev])\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "   where `prev` is the index of the last job that doesn't overlap with job `i`.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Final Result**: The value in `dp[n]` (where `n` is the total number of jobs) will give us the maximum profit we can earn without overlapping jobs.\n",

        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve the problem of counting square submatrices with all ones, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain a 2D DP array where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square submatrix with all ones that ends at the cell `(i, j)` in the matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps:\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - Create a DP array of the same dimensions as the input matrix, initialized to zero.\n",
        "   - If the cell in the matrix is `1`, then we can potentially form a square submatrix ending at that cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Relation**:\n",
        "   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix:\n",
        "     - If `matrix[i][j]` is `1`, we can use the values from the left, top, and top-left diagonal cells to determine the size of the square that can end at `(i, j)`.\n",
        "     - The size can be calculated as:\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "     - If `matrix[i][j]` is `0`, `dp[i][j]` remains `0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Count the Squares**:\n",
        "   - The value of `dp[i][j]` gives the size of the largest square submatrix ending at `(i, j)`. To find the total number of squares, we can simply sum up all the values in `dp`, since a square of size `k` contributes `k` submatrices of size `1`, `2`, ..., `k`.\n",
        "\n",

        "To solve the problem of Palindrome Partitioning III, we need a clear approach to determine the minimum number of character changes required to partition a string into `k` palindromic substrings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding Palindromes**:\n",
        "   A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. Thus, for any substring, to check if it can be made into a palindrome, we need to ensure that characters can be paired up, with at most one unpaired character allowed (which would be the middle character in an odd-length palindrome).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n",
        "   We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve this problem. We'll maintain two DP tables:\n",
        "   - `dp[i][j]`: The minimum number of changes needed to partition the substring `s[0:i]` into `j` palindromic substrings.\n",
        "   - `palindrome_cost[i][j]`: The number of changes required to make the substring `s[i:j]` a palindrome.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Base Cases**:\n",
        "   - When `j = 1`, the whole substring `s[0:i]` must be a palindrome, thus we can directly compute the changes needed.\n",
        "   - When `i` equals `j`, we only need to change if `k` is greater than the length of the substring.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filling the Tables**:\n",
        "   We'll iterate over possible substring lengths and compute the necessary changes based on previously computed values in the DP table. We need to consider all possible positions to split the substring into palindromic parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**:\n",
        "   The minimum number of changes required to partition the entire string into `k` palindromic substrings will be stored in `dp[n][k]`, where `n` is the length of the string.\n",

        "To solve the problem of finding the maximum score and the number of distinct paths with that score from the bottom-right to the top-left of a board, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. Here’s a step-by-step guide through the process:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Explanation of the Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Board Representation**: \n",
        "   - The board is a 2D grid where each cell can either be an integer ('1' to '9'), 'S' (start), 'E' (end), or 'X' (obstacle).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: \n",
        "   - We'll maintain two 2D arrays:\n",
        "     - `dp[i][j]`: This will store the maximum score obtainable up to cell `(i, j)`.\n",
        "     - `count[i][j]`: This will store the number of ways to reach cell `(i, j)` with the maximum score.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Initialization**: \n",
        "   - Start by initializing the `dp` table with negative infinity (to denote unreachable cells) except for the starting cell `S` (bottom-right), which we initialize based on its score.\n",
        "   - The `count` table will initially have 0s, except for the starting position where it will be 1 (indicating one way to start).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filling the Tables**: \n",
        "   - We iterate from bottom-right to top-left, checking possible moves (up, left, and up-left) and updating the `dp` and `count` tables accordingly:\n",
        "     - For each cell `(i, j)`, check the three possible previous positions.\n",
        "     - If a previous position leads to a higher score, update the score and reset the count.\n",
        "     - If a previous position leads to the same maximum score, add to the count.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**: \n",
        "   - After filling the tables, the result is found at the top-left cell. If it's still negative infinity, it means there's no valid path.\n",

        "To solve the problem of finding the minimum distance to type a word using two fingers on a keyboard arranged in a grid, we can use dynamic programming. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Keyboard Mapping**: First, we need to establish the coordinates of each letter on the keyboard. For example, 'A' is at (0, 0), 'B' is at (0, 1), and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated using the Manhattan distance formula: `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We'll define a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum distance required to type the first `i` characters of the word using two fingers, where finger 1 ends on the `j`-th character of the word.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Transition**: For every character in the word, we will consider all possible positions for the two fingers and calculate the distance:\n",
        "   - If finger 1 types the current character, we calculate the distance from where finger 1 was last positioned.\n",
        "   - If finger 2 types the current character, we calculate the distance from where finger 2 was last positioned.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Initialization**: Since the initial positions of the fingers are free, we can initialize the DP array for the first two letters of the word.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Final Result**: After filling the DP table, the minimum distance to type the entire word will be the minimum value in the last row of the DP table.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n",
        "   - We have a list of job difficulties and we need to divide them into `d` days. Each day must have at least one job.\n",
        "   - The difficulty for a day is defined as the maximum difficulty of the jobs scheduled on that day. The total difficulty of the schedule is the sum of the difficulties for each day.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:\n",
        "   - We will use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum difficulty to schedule the first `i` jobs in `j` days.\n",
        "   - The goal is to compute the values in this table such that the final result is `dp[n][d]`, where `n` is the number of jobs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Base Cases**:\n",
        "   - If `d` is greater than the number of jobs (`n`), it is impossible to schedule them, hence return `-1`.\n",
        "   - If `d` equals `n`, the only schedule is one job per day, and the total difficulty is the sum of all job difficulties.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - For each day `j` from `1` to `d`, and for each job `i` from `1` to `n`, we consider all possible end points for the last job scheduled on day `j`. \n",
        "   - We maintain a variable to track the maximum difficulty of jobs scheduled on that day.\n",
        "   - For each possible end point, we update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum value considering the maximum difficulty of the jobs done that day.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**:\n",
        "   - After filling the DP table, the result will be found in `dp[n][d]`.\n",

        "### Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:\n",

        "   - The total number of slices is `3n`, and you can pick `n` slices in total.\n",
        "   - The slices you can pick will affect the slices available for Alice and Bob, which means we have to consider combinations carefully.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - The main challenge is to properly handle the circular nature of the pizza while ensuring that you only pick `n` slices.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Loop through the Slices**:\n",
        "   - Since the slices are circular, we will treat the problem as two separate cases:\n",
        "     - Picking slices from index `0` to index `n-1`.\n",
        "     - Picking slices from index `1` to index `n`.\n",

        "- Are lexicographically smaller than or equal to `s2`\n",
        "- Do not contain the substring `evil`\n",

        "To do this efficiently, we can use dynamic programming (DP) with memoization and a finite state machine (FSM) to track how many characters of `evil` we have matched so far. The DP states will be defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `i`: the current position in the string being formed (0 to n)\n",
        "- `j`: the current position in the string `evil` that we are matching against\n",
        "- `is_prefix1`: a boolean that indicates if we are still constrained by `s1` (true means we are still below `s1`)\n",
        "- `is_prefix2`: a boolean that indicates if we are still constrained by `s2` (true means we are still above `s2`)\n",
        "\n",
        "The transitions will depend on choosing each character from 'a' to 'z' and checking if the new character keeps the string within the bounds of `s1` and `s2`, while also updating the matched state for `evil`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Steps:\n",
        "1. **Precompute Failure Function**: Create a failure function for `evil` that helps to quickly know the next state when a character does not match.\n",
        "2. **DP Function**: Define a recursive DP function that uses memoization to avoid recomputation.\n",
        "3. **Count Valid Strings**: For each character choice, update the bounds and check the next state against `evil`.\n",

        "### Approach Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where we maintain a score difference between Alice and Bob as they play optimally. The key idea is to think of the game in terms of states based on the remaining stones.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dynamic Programming State Definition**:\n",
        "   - Let `dp[i]` be the maximum score difference that the player (Alice in this case) can achieve starting from index `i` of the `stoneValue` array. A positive value indicates that Alice can win, while a negative value indicates Bob will win. A value of zero indicates a tie.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Transition**:\n",
        "   - At each index `i`, Alice can choose to take 1, 2, or 3 stones. The score she can achieve from that choice is the sum of the selected stones plus the score difference from the subsequent state (where Bob plays optimally).\n",
        "   - The score difference after Alice's turn would be calculated as follows:\n",
        "     - If Alice takes 1 stone: `dp[i] = stoneValue[i] - dp[i+1]`\n",
        "     - If Alice takes 2 stones: `dp[i] = stoneValue[i] + stoneValue[i+1] - dp[i+2]`\n",
        "     - If Alice takes 3 stones: `dp[i] = stoneValue[i] + stoneValue[i+1] + stoneValue[i+2] - dp[i+3]`\n",
        "   - We will take the maximum of these choices to determine the best possible outcome for Alice starting from index `i`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Base Cases**:\n",
        "   - If `i` is out of bounds (beyond the last stone), `dp[i]` should be 0.\n",
        "   - If `i` is at the last stone, `dp[i]` is simply the value of that stone since Alice will take it.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Decision**:\n",
        "   - After filling the `dp` table, the outcome is determined by the value of `dp[0]`. If it’s greater than 0, Alice wins; if less than 0, Bob wins; and if equal to 0, it’s a tie.\n",

        "   - **Different:** If all cells in the current row are different from the previous row, the formula is \\( 2 \\times same + 2 \\times different \\).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n",
        "    - We need to construct an array `arr` of size `n` with elements between 1 and `m`.\n",
        "    - We want the maximum element in this array to be found using exactly `k` comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Key Observations**:\n",
        "    - The maximum value in the array must be the same for the maximum comparisons needed (denoted as `k`).\n",
        "    - If `k` is 0, the maximum element must be the smallest (i.e., all elements are equal), and therefore can only be 1. \n",
        "    - If `k` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to find the maximum with the required comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n",
        "    - We will use a dynamic programming approach to count the valid arrays.\n",
        "    - We'll define a 3D DP table `dp[i][j][x]` where:\n",
        "        - `i` is the number of elements processed,\n",
        "        - `j` is the maximum element used so far,\n",
        "        - `x` is the number of comparisons used to find the maximum.\n",
        "    - The transitions will be based on whether we are adding a number less than or equal to `j` or exactly `j`.\n",
        "\n",

        "    - If we add a number less than `j`, we don't increase the comparison count.\n",
        "    - If we add `j`, we increase the count of maximum comparisons by 1.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Initialization**: \n",

        "  \n",
        "3. **Maintain a Deque**: \n",
        "   - Use a deque to maintain indices of the `dp` array. The elements in the deque will represent the indices of the `dp` array that could potentially contribute to the maximum sum for the current element being processed, while also ensuring the constraint of distance `k` is maintained.\n",
        "   - The deque will store indices in decreasing order of their corresponding `dp` values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filling the DP Array**:\n",
        "   - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, perform the following:\n",
        "     - Remove indices from the front of the deque if they are out of the valid range (i.e., more than `k` distance away).\n",
        "     - If the deque is not empty, set `dp[i]` to `nums[i] + dp[deque[0]]`, which is the maximum sum from the deque.\n",
        "     - Then, add the current index `i` to the deque. Before adding, we should remove indices from the back of the deque while the current `dp[i]` is greater than the `dp` value at the back of the deque (to maintain the decreasing order).\n",

        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will use a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[j]` will store the maximum length of the string that can be formed with a total cost of `j`. We will also track which digit we used to reach that cost.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Filling the DP Table**: For each digit from `1` to `9`, we will iterate through the DP array backwards (from `target` to the cost of the digit). This prevents overwriting results from the current iteration. If the current cost allows us to include the digit, we will check if appending the digit to the existing number at that cost would result in a larger number. If so, we update the DP table.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Result Extraction**: After filling the DP table, we will check `dp[target]`. If it's empty, it means we couldn't create any number with the given cost, and we should return \"0\". Otherwise, we return the largest number found.\n",

        "To solve the \"Allocate Mailboxes\" problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with a precomputation of distances. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting the Houses**: \n",
        "   - First, we need to sort the `houses` array. This allows us to easily compute the distance between houses and potential mailbox positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Precomputing Distance Costs**:\n",
        "   - We create a 2D array `cost` where `cost[i][j]` represents the minimum distance for placing a single mailbox among houses from index `i` to `j`. This is calculated based on the median of the houses in that range, as the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n",
        "   - We create a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum distance when placing `j` mailboxes for the first `i` houses. The base case is when we have one mailbox for all houses, which can be filled using the precomputed `cost`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - For each number of mailboxes and each house, we iterate through possible positions for the last mailbox and update the DP table with minimum distances.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**:\n",
        "   - The final result `dp[n][k]` gives us the minimum total distance for placing `k` mailboxes for `n` houses.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding Run-Length Encoding**: \n",
        "   - Characters that appear consecutively (repeated) can be compressed into a character followed by a number indicating the count of repetitions (if the count is more than 1).\n",
        "   - For instance, \"aaabcccd\" can be compressed to \"a3bc3d\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:\n",
        "   - We'll create a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the index of the string and `j` represents the number of deletions used. \n",
        "   - `dp[i][j]` will store the minimum length of the compressed string considering the first `i` characters with at most `j` deletions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transitions**:\n",
        "   - For every group of consecutive identical characters, we can decide how many of them to keep after making deletions.\n",
        "   - If we have a group of `count` consecutive characters, we can remove up to `k` characters from this group. Thus, we calculate the compression length for different scenarios of keeping `count`, `count-1`, ..., down to `max(0, count - k)` characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - We start with `dp[0][0] = 0`, meaning zero length for an empty string.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**:\n",
        "   - After filling the DP table, the answer will be in `dp[n][k]`, where `n` is the length of the string.\n",

        "- The base case is that if there are no cuts between `i` and `j`, the cost is `0`.\n",

        "  - The cost of making cut `k` is the length of the stick segment, which is `j - i`.\n",

        "To solve the problem of finding the maximum non-negative product in a matrix while only moving right or down, we can utilize dynamic programming. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We'll maintain two tables:\n",
        "   - `max_product[i][j]`: This will store the maximum non-negative product that can be obtained to reach cell `(i, j)`.\n",
        "   - `min_product[i][j]`: This will store the minimum (most negative) product that can be obtained to reach cell `(i, j)`. This is necessary because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initialization**: Start at the top-left corner of the grid:\n",
        "   - Initialize `max_product[0][0]` and `min_product[0][0]` with the value of `grid[0][0]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fill the DP Tables**: Iterate through each cell in the grid and compute the maximum and minimum products by considering the cells from which we can come (from the left or from above):\n",
        "   - If the current cell is positive, it can be multiplied by the max product from the previous cells.\n",
        "   - If the current cell is negative, we must consider:\n",
        "     - Multiplying by the minimum product (to potentially become positive).\n",
        "     - Multiplying by the maximum product (which could become negative).\n",
        "   - If the current cell is zero, both max and min products for that cell will be zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Result**: At the bottom-right corner of the grid, check the value of `max_product[m-1][n-1]`. If it's negative, return -1. Otherwise, return the value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n",

        "To solve the problem of connecting two groups of points with minimum cost, we can use a combination of bit manipulation and dynamic programming (DP). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to connect every point in the first group (size1) to at least one point in the second group (size2) and vice versa. The cost of connecting each point is given in a 2D matrix, where `cost[i][j]` represents the cost to connect point `i` from the first group to point `j` from the second group.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Bit Masking**: We can represent the connections between the points in the second group using a bitmask. For example, if `size2 = 3`, the bitmask `011` indicates that points 2 and 3 in the second group are connected (counting from 0). This allows us to easily check which points are connected.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming**: We'll maintain a DP array where `dp[mask]` represents the minimum cost to connect all points in the first group with the points represented by `mask` in the second group. The size of `mask` is `2^size2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Transition**: For each state represented by `mask`, we will try to connect additional points in the second group and update the cost. We iterate through each point in the first group and consider connecting it to all points in the second group that are not yet connected in `mask`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**: The answer will be found in `dp[(1 << size2) - 1]`, which represents the cost of connecting all points in both groups.\n",

        "\n",
        "To solve the problem of selecting the best basketball team with no conflicts, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The key steps in our solution are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pairing and Sorting**: We start by pairing each player's age with their score and sorting these pairs. This sorting is crucial because it allows us to easily manage the conflict rule: we only need to consider younger players with lower or equal scores if they are older or of the same age.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We create a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score we can achieve by including the player at index `i` in the team. Initially, each player can at least be on the team by themselves, so we set `dp[i] = scores[i]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Building the DP Array**: For each player `i`, we check all previous players `j` (where `j < i`). If the player at index `j` is not conflicting with player `i` (i.e., `ages[j] <= ages[i]` and `scores[j] <= scores[i]`), we can consider adding player `i` to the team formed by the players up to `j`. Thus, we update `dp[i]` as:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding a Mountain Array**: A mountain array is defined by having a peak element (i) where all elements before it are strictly increasing and all elements after it are strictly decreasing. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Finding Increasing and Decreasing Subsequences**:\n",
        "   - To find the longest mountain array, we need to find two things:\n",
        "     - The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) that ends at each position.\n",
        "     - The longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) that starts at each position.\n",
        "   - The peak of the mountain must be the highest value in the array, and we can only have a peak at indices `1` to `n-2` (where `n` is the length of the array).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Using Dynamic Programming**:\n",
        "   - We will create two arrays: `increasing` and `decreasing`.\n",
        "   - `increasing[i]` will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at index `i`.\n",
        "   - `decreasing[i]` will store the length of the longest decreasing subsequence that starts at index `i`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Calculate the Longest Mountain**:\n",
        "   - For each potential peak (from index 1 to `n-2`), calculate the total length of the mountain which is `increasing[i] + decreasing[i] - 1` (subtracting 1 because the peak element is counted in both).\n",
        "   - The maximum length of a mountain found will give us the maximum length of the mountain array.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Compute the Result**:\n",

        "To solve the problem of finding the maximum height by stacking cuboids, we can break down the solution into a series of steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Normalization of Dimensions**: Since we can rotate the cuboids, the first step is to normalize the dimensions of each cuboid. We will sort the dimensions of each cuboid so that the width is always the smallest dimension, the length is the middle dimension, and the height is the largest dimension. This allows us to treat the problem consistently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sorting Cuboids**: Once the dimensions are normalized, we will sort the cuboids. The sorting will help in ensuring that we can easily check if one cuboid can be placed on top of another. We will sort primarily by width, then by length, and finally by height.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We will use a dynamic programming approach where we maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum height of the stack ending with the `i-th` cuboid. For each cuboid `i`, we will check all previous cuboids `j` (where `j < i`) and see if cuboid `i` can be placed on cuboid `j`. If it can, we will update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the height of cuboid `i` plus `dp[j]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Result**: The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum height we can obtain by stacking the cuboids.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Approach Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **State Representation**: The game can be represented by the positions of the Cat and Mouse, as well as whose turn it is. The positions can be represented as `(mouse_x, mouse_y, cat_x, cat_y, is_mouse_turn)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Movement**: Both the Cat and Mouse can jump a maximum distance defined by `catJump` and `mouseJump`, respectively. We can derive all possible positions they can move to from their current positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Winning Conditions**:\n",
        "   - If the Cat and Mouse occupy the same position, the Cat wins.\n",

        "   - If the Mouse reaches the Food first, the Mouse wins.\n",
        "   - If the Mouse cannot reach the Food in 1000 turns, the Cat wins.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **DFS with Memoization**: We'll use DFS to simulate the game, checking all possible moves for both players. To avoid recalculating states we've already examined, we will use a memoization dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Optimal Play**: Both players will make moves that maximize their chance of winning. The Cat will try to move in ways that prevent the Mouse from reaching the Food, while the Mouse will try to reach the Food or evade the Cat.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n",
        "   - We are given a list of events, each defined by a start day, an end day, and a value.\n",
        "   - We can attend a maximum of `k` events, ensuring that no two events overlap. This means if an event ends on a certain day, we cannot start another event on that same day.\n",

        "   - We first sort the events by their end days. This enables efficient searching of non-overlapping events.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming Table**:\n",
        "   - We define a DP table `dp[j][i]`, where:\n",
        "     - `j` represents the number of events attended (from `0` to `k`).\n",
        "     - `i` represents the index of the event being considered.\n",
        "     - `dp[j][i]` represents the maximum value that can be achieved by attending up to `j` events from the first `i` events.\n",

        "4. **Transition**:\n",
        "   - For each event, we have two choices:\n",
        "     - **Skip the event**: The value remains the same as `dp[j][i-1]`.\n",
        "     - **Attend the event**: We can add its value to the maximum value of attending `j-1` events that do not overlap with the current event. We use binary search to find the last event that ends before the current event starts.\n",

        "### Explanation of the Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve the problem of maximizing the number of happy groups in a donut shop, we need to strategically arrange the groups of customers based on their sizes in a way that optimizes the use of the batch size provided. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Points to Consider:\n",
        "1. **Happy Group Condition**: A group is happy if their total size can fit into the current batch of donuts without using leftovers from the previous batch. This means that if a group size exceeds the available space in the current batch (i.e., `batchSize`), then they will not be happy if served immediately after a group that has left over donuts.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Rearranging Groups**: Since we can freely rearrange the groups, we need to explore different combinations of serving these groups to maximize happiness.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can utilize a depth-first search (DFS) strategy combined with memoization to explore the possibilities of serving groups while keeping track of the current leftover donuts. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Group Size Constraints**: Since the maximum group size can be large (up to \\(10^9\\)), we need to ensure that we only consider the sizes of the groups that can actually fit within the `batchSize`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Modulo Concept**: We can define the problem in terms of the modulo of the batch size. Essentially, we can track how many donuts we have left after serving groups and how this affects the next group that arrives.\n",

        "\n",
        "To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of side jumps needed for the frog to reach the end of the road while avoiding obstacles, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to keep track of the minimum side jumps required for each lane at every point along the road.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - We start at point 0 in lane 2, and initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of side jumps required to reach point `i` in each lane. The frog starts in lane 2, so we set `dp[0][2] = 0` and the other lanes at point 0 to infinity (or a large number).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterate through each point**:\n",
        "   - For each point from 1 to `n`, we need to decide how to move based on whether there is an obstacle in each lane:\n",
        "     - If there's no obstacle in the current lane, the frog can move forward (i.e., `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`).\n",
        "     - If there's an obstacle, the frog must consider side jumps to other lanes at the same position.\n",
        "     - The frog can jump to any lane that does not have an obstacle at the current point.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:\n",
        "   - For each lane at each point, if moving forward is not possible due to an obstacle, we check the other lanes and calculate the required jumps.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Result Extraction**:\n",
        "   - At the end of the iterations, the result will be the minimum of `dp[n][1]`, `dp[n][2]`, and `dp[n][3]`, which represents the minimum side jumps needed to reach the end of the road on any lane.\n",

        "\n",
        "The problem requires us to determine the optimal score difference between Alice and Bob when both play optimally. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how we can solve this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cumulative Sum**: \n",
        "   - We can leverage the fact that the players can only remove stones from the leftmost side. Thus, we can maintain a cumulative sum of the stones to represent the total value of stones removed at each turn.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Single Move**:\n",
        "   - Since Alice starts first and aims to maximize her score difference while Bob aims to minimize it, we can observe that every move can be viewed as adjusting the score difference based on the cumulative value of the stones removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Iterative Calculation**:\n",
        "   - Starting from the leftmost stone, we calculate the cumulative sum of all stones. For each potential move (from removing the first `x` stones where `x` can range from 2 to `n`), we keep track of the optimal score difference that can be achieved by both players.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Programming**:\n",
        "   - We can utilize a dynamic programming-like approach where we keep updating the maximum score difference that Alice can achieve after each potential move.\n",

        "### Approach Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve the \"Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors\" problem, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to minimize the maximum number of drops required to find the critical floor `f`.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of moves required to find the critical floor with `i` eggs and `j` floors.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Base Cases**:\n",
        "   - If we have 1 egg (`i = 1`), we must drop the egg from every floor one by one. Thus, `dp[1][j] = j` for any `j` floors.\n",
        "   - If we have 0 floors (`j = 0`), we need 0 moves: `dp[i][0] = 0`.\n",
        "   - If we have 1 floor (`j = 1`), we need 1 move: `dp[i][1] = 1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
        "   - For each combination of eggs and floors, we will attempt dropping the egg from every floor `x` (1 to `j`).\n",
        "   - If the egg breaks, we need to check below (`x-1` floors) with one less egg (`i-1` eggs).\n",
        "   - If the egg does not break, we check the floors above (`j-x` floors) with the same number of eggs (`i` eggs).\n",
        "   - We need to find the floor `x` that minimizes the maximum of these two scenarios:\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     dp[i][j] = 1 + \\min_{1 \\leq x \\leq j} \\max(dp[i-1][x-1], dp[i][j-x])\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Optimization**: Since we are trying to minimize the maximum of two values, we can optimize our search for `x` to reduce the number of iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**: The answer will be in `dp[2][n]`, where `2` is the number of eggs and `n` is the number of floors.\n",

        "\n",
        "A subsequence is considered special if it contains at least one `0`, followed by at least one `1`, and then at least one `2`. This means our subsequence must have the structure: `0...01...12...2`. \n",

        "- If the element is `1`, any existing subsequence of `0`s can be extended by this `1` to form new subsequences (`c1`). The total subsequences with `1`s will be updated based on existing counts of `0s` and the new `1`.\n",
        "- If the element is `2`, any valid subsequence already formed with `0s` and `1s` can be extended by this `2` to form new special subsequences. The total count of valid subsequences (`c2`) is updated based on the existing count of `1s`.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. Explanation of the Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to minimize the wasted space when resizing the dynamic array at most `k` times. The main idea is to:\n",
        "- Use dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum wasted space for every possible number of resizing operations up to `k`.\n",
        "- Use a two-dimensional DP array where `dp[i][j]` will represent the minimum total space wasted using the first `i` elements with `j` resizing operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Detailed Steps:\n",
        "1. **Sorting**: First, sort the `nums` array. This will help in determining the size of the dynamic array more efficiently as we can take the largest number needed for resizing at each segment.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: Create a DP table where:\n",
        "   - `dp[i][j]` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`) since we want to find the minimum.\n",
        "   - `dp[0][0]` is initialized to `0` because if there are no elements, there’s no wasted space.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calculate Wasted Space**: For every end index `i` in `nums`, calculate the total wasted space if we decided to resize the array at different positions. For each possible `j` (number of resizes used):\n",
        "   - Calculate the maximum size needed for the segment from the last resize point to the current point.\n",
        "   - Update the DP table based on whether we use another resize or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Result**: The answer will be found in `dp[n][j]` where `j` varies from `0` to `k`, and `n` is the length of `nums`.\n",

The expected output should be `0`, as there are no balloons to burst.\n\n2. **Single Balloon**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5]`\n   - **Description**: Test with only one balloon. The expected output should be `5`, as the only calculation involves treating the out-of-bounds balloons as `1` (1 * 5 * 1).\n\n3. **Two Balloons**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [3, 4]`\n   - **Description**: Test with two balloons. The expected output should be `3 * 4 + 4 * 1 + 1 * 3 = 12 + 4 + 3 = 19`.\n\n4. **All Zeros**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description**: Test with balloons having zero values. The expected output should be `0`, as all calculations will yield zero coins.\n\n5. **Maximum Size with Maximum Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [100] * 300`\n   - **Description**: Test the maximum constraint of the input size with the maximum value for each balloon. This will test the performance and ensure the algorithm can handle large inputs without exceeding time limits.\n\n6. **Duplicates with Varying Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: Test with duplicate values. This will help verify that the algorithm correctly considers the optimal order of bursting balloons to maximize coins.\n\n7. **Increasing Sequence**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: Test with an increasing sequence of values. This will help assess whether the algorithm can identify the optimal bursting order for a straightforward increasing pattern.\n\n8. **Decreasing Sequence**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: Test with a decreasing sequence of values.

If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.\n\nSome of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight&#39;s health (represented by positive integers).\n\nTo reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.\n\nReturn the knight&#39;s minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.\n\nNote that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: dungeon = [[0]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == dungeon.length\n\tn == dungeon[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 200\n\t-1000 <= dungeon[i][j] <= 1000\n\n"

This tests the handling of negative values in the simplest case.\n\n2. **Single Room with Zero Health**:\n   - Input: `dungeon = [[0]]`\n   - Description: The knight starts in a room that has no effect on health. This checks if the implementation correctly handles the case where the knight needs at least 1 health point to survive.\n\n3. **Single Room with Positive Health**:\n   - Input: `dungeon = [[5]]`\n   - Description: The knight starts in a room that increases his health. This tests if the implementation can correctly identify that the knight can start with 1 health point.\n\n4. **Straight Path with Mixed Values**:\n   - Input: `dungeon = [[-2, 0, 3], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, -5]]`\n   - Description: A path that has both negative and zero values. This tests the knight's ability to navigate through rooms with varying effects on health.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Dungeon with All Negative Values**:\n   - Input: `dungeon = [[-1]*200 for _ in range(200)]`\n   - Description: A 200x200 dungeon where every room has a negative value. This tests the performance and the ability to handle the maximum constraints.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Dungeon with Mixed Values**:\n   - Input: `dungeon = [[-1]*100 + [1]*100] * 100`\n   - Description: A 200x200 dungeon with the first half of each row being negative and the second half being positive. This tests the algorithm's ability to navigate through a complex grid efficiently.\n\n7. **Path with Multiple Power-ups and Threats**:\n   - Input: `dungeon = [[-2, 3, 0], [4, -5, 1], [0, 0, -10]]`\n   - Description: A grid where the knight must choose between paths with both threats and power-ups, testing the pathfinding logic.\n\n8. **All Zero Values**:\n   - Input: `dungeon = [[0]*200 for _ in range(200)]`\n   - Description: A 200x200 dungeon where all rooms have zero effect.

This tests the base case where there is only one element and no inverse pairs can exist.\n\n2. **Single Element with Non-zero Inverse Pairs**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 1`, `k = 1`\n   - **Description**: This tests the scenario where there are no possible inverse pairs because there is only one element. The expected output should be 0.\n\n3. **Maximum n with Zero Inverse Pairs**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 1000`, `k = 0`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of `n` with zero inverse pairs. The expected output should be 1, as the only valid array is the sorted array from 1 to 1000.\n\n4. **Maximum n with Maximum k**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 1000`, `k = 1000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limits for both `n` and `k`. This checks if the function can handle large values and compute the number of arrays with the maximum number of inverse pairs.\n\n5. **n equals k**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5`, `k = 5`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case where the number of elements equals the number of inverse pairs. The expected output should be calculated based on the specific arrangements that yield exactly 5 inverse pairs.\n\n6. **k Greater than Maximum Possible Inverse Pairs**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 5`, `k = 10`\n   - **Description**: This tests the scenario where `k` exceeds the maximum possible inverse pairs for the given `n`. The expected output should be 0, as it is impossible to have more inverse pairs than the maximum possible.\n\n7. **Random Mid-range Values**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`\n   - **Description**: This tests a typical case with moderate values of `n` and `k`. It helps ensure that the algorithm can compute the number of valid arrays for non-trivial cases.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case with High k**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 10`, `k = 45`\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance of the algorithm when `k` is at its maximum possible value for `n = 10`, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. The output should be calculated based on the maximum number of inverse pairs possible.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety"

        "A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:\n\n\n&#39;A&#39; -> &quot;1&quot;\n&#39;B&#39; -> &quot;2&quot;\n...\n&#39;Z&#39; -> &quot;26&quot;\n\n\nTo decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, &quot;11106&quot; can be mapped into:\n\n\n\t&quot;AAJF&quot; with the grouping (1 1 10 6)\n\t&quot;KJF&quot; with the grouping (11 10 6)\n\n\nNote that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because &quot;06&quot; cannot be mapped into &#39;F&#39; since &quot;6&quot; is different from &quot;06&quot;.\n\nIn addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the &#39;*&#39; character, which can represent any digit from &#39;1&#39; to &#39;9&#39; (&#39;0&#39; is excluded). For example, the encoded message &quot;1*&quot; may represent any of the encoded messages &quot;11&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, &quot;13&quot;, &quot;14&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;18&quot;, or &quot;19&quot;. Decoding &quot;1*&quot; is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.\n\nGiven a string s consisting of digits and &#39;*&#39; characters, return the number of ways to decode it.\n\nSince the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: s = &quot;*&quot;\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, or &quot;9&quot;.\nEach of these can be decoded to the strings &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; respectively.\nHence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode &quot;*&quot;.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: s = &quot;1*&quot;\nOutput: 18\nExplanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages &quot;11&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, &quot;13&quot;, &quot;14&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;18&quot;, or &quot;19&quot;.\nEach of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. &quot;11&quot; can be decoded to &quot;AA&quot; or &quot;K&quot;).\nHence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode &quot;1*&quot;.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: s = &quot;2*&quot;\nOutput: 15\nExplanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages &quot;21&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, &quot;26&quot;, &quot;27&quot;, &quot;28&quot;, or &quot;29&quot;.\n&quot;21&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, and &quot;26&quot; have 2 ways of being decoded, but &quot;27&quot;, &quot;28&quot;, and &quot;29&quot; only have 1 way.\nHence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode &quot;2*&quot;.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 105\n\ts[i] is a digit or &#39;*&#39;.\n\n"

This should return 9, as '*' can represent any digit from 1 to 9.\n\n2. **Single Character Test with a Digit**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"1\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest case with a single digit. This should return 1, as \"1\" can only be decoded as \"A\".\n\n3. **Two Character Test with '*'**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"**\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where both characters are '*'. This should return 81, as each '*' can represent any digit from 1 to 9 independently.\n\n4. **Two Character Test with Valid Digits**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"26\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the input consists of two valid digits. This should return 2, as \"26\" can be decoded as \"Z\" or \"BF\".\n\n5. **Combination of Digits and '*'**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"1*\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a mix of a digit and a '*'. This should return 18, as explained in the problem statement, since \"1*\" can represent \"11\" to \"19\".\n\n6. **Leading Zero Test**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"01\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with a leading zero. This should return 0, as \"01\" cannot be decoded into any valid letter.\n\n7. **Maximum Length Test**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"*\" * 100000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance edge case with the maximum input size of 100,000 characters, all being '*'. This tests the efficiency and performance of the solution.\n\n8. **Complex Mixed Case**:\n   - **Input**: `s = \"1*2*3*\"`\n   - **Description**: Tests a more complex case with a mix of digits and '*' characters. This should return a calculated number based on the various combinations of decoding the '*' characters, ensuring the algorithm handles multiple '*' correctly in the context of surrounding digits.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the decoding algorithm."

There are no elements to form any combinations, so the output should be zero.\n\n2. **Single Element Less Than Target**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [2], target = 5`\n   - **Output**: `2`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where there is only one element in the array that is less than the target. The combinations are `(2, 2, 1)` and `(2, 1, 2)`.\n\n3. **Single Element Equal to Target**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5], target = 5`\n   - **Output**: `1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the single element in the array is equal to the target. There is only one combination: `(5)`.\n\n4. **Single Element Greater Than Target**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [10], target = 5`\n   - **Output**: `0`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the single element is greater than the target. No combinations can be formed, so the output should be zero.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Array with Small Values**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 1000`\n   - **Output**: (large number, needs calculation)\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance with the maximum size of the input array and a large target. This checks if the solution can handle larger computations efficiently.\n\n6. **Large Distinct Integers**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [100, 200, 300], target = 600`\n   - **Output**: `1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the target can only be achieved by using all elements in the array exactly once. This checks if the algorithm correctly identifies unique combinations.\n\n7. **Target is Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 0`\n   - **Output**: `1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the edge case where the target is zero. There is one way to achieve a sum of zero: using no elements at all.\n\n8. **Negative Numbers (Follow-up Case)**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-1, -2, -3], target = -4`\n   - **Output**: (needs calculation)\n   - **Description**: Tests the follow-up scenario where negative numbers are allowed.

The expected output should be `0`.\n\n2. **Single Element Case**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"0\"], m = 1, n = 0`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest case with a single binary string that fits within the constraints. The expected output should be `1`.\n\n3. **Single Element Exceeding Limits**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"111\"], m = 0, n = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests a single string that exceeds the limits of either `m` or `n`. The expected output should be `0`.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"0\"] * 600, m = 600, n = 0`\n   - **Description**: Tests the maximum input size with all strings being \"0\".

Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.\n\nReturn true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: nums = [1,5,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. \nIf he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). \nSo, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. \nHence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: nums = [1,5,233,7]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.\nFinally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 20\n\t0 <= nums[i] <= 107\n\n"

Expected output: `0`.\n\n4. **All Zeros with Zero Target**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 0, 0, 0], target = 0`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario where all elements are zero and the target is also zero.

The expected output is `1` since removing the single box yields `1 * 1 = 1` point.\n\n2. **All Boxes Same Color**: \n   - Input: `boxes = [2, 2, 2, 2]`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario where all boxes are of the same color. The expected output is `16` since removing all boxes at once yields `4 * 4 = 16` points.\n\n3. **Alternating Colors**: \n   - Input: `boxes = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`\n   - Description: Tests a case with alternating colors. The expected output is `9`, as the optimal strategy involves removing boxes in pairs.\n\n4. **Maximum Size with Unique Colors**: \n   - Input: `boxes = [i for i in range(1, 101)]`\n   - Description: Tests the upper limit of the input size with unique colors. The expected output should be calculated based on the optimal strategy, which may involve removing boxes in segments.\n\n5. **Maximum Size with Duplicates**: \n   - Input: `boxes = [1] * 100`\n   - Description: Tests the upper limit of the input size with all boxes being the same color. The expected output is `10000` since removing all boxes at once yields `100 * 100 = 10000` points.\n\n6. **Nested Duplicates**: \n   - Input: `boxes = [1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]`\n   - Description: Tests a case where boxes can be removed in different sequences. The expected output should be calculated based on the optimal strategy, which may involve removing the inner boxes first.\n\n7. **Empty Input**: \n   - Input: `boxes = []`\n   - Description: Tests the edge case of an empty input. The expected output is `0` since there are no boxes to remove.\n\n8. **Large Group with Small Groups**: \n   - Input: `boxes = [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3]`\n   - Description: Tests a case where a large group of boxes is surrounded by smaller groups. The expected output should be calculated based on the optimal strategy, which may involve removing the smaller groups first to maximize points from the larger group.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance edge cases, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the solution."

        "The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The key idea is to use a 3D array `dp` where `dp[l][r][k]` represents the maximum points obtainable by removing boxes from index `l` to `r` with `k` additional boxes of the same color as `boxes[r]` already removed before `l` (which enables us to gain extra points).",

        "",
        "2. **Base Case**: If we remove a segment of boxes from `l` to `r`, we get points equal to `(k + 1) * (k + 1)` for the boxes at index `r` if they are contiguous. This means if `boxes[r]` is the same color as the box at `r-1`, we can merge them together.",
        "",
        "3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:",
        "   - We iterate over possible lengths of segments and try to calculate the maximum points we can achieve.",

The expected output is 3 (records: \"P\", \"A\", \"L\").\n\n2. **Small Input Case (n = 2)**:\n   - Input: `n = 2`\n   - This tests a small record length where the output should be 8. It checks the basic combinations of attendance records with the constraints applied.\n\n3. **Absence Limit Edge Case (n = 3)**:\n   - Input: `n = 3`\n   - This tests the scenario where the record can have a maximum of 1 absence. The expected output should be calculated considering combinations like \"PPP\", \"PPA\", \"PAL\", etc.\n\n4. **Late Limit Edge Case (n = 4)**:\n   - Input: `n = 4`\n   - This checks for records that can have late days but not 3 consecutive ones.
