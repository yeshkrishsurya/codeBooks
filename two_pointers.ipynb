The expected output should be the area formed by the first and last lines, which tests if the algorithm correctly identifies the maximum area in a uniform scenario.\n\n3. **Increasing Heights**:\n   - **Input**: `height = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: A strictly increasing sequence of heights.

This case ensures that the algorithm can reproduce the expected output correctly.\n\n7. **Zero Heights**:\n   - **Input**: `height = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`\n   - **Description**: A case with alternating zero heights. This tests if the algorithm can correctly handle heights of zero and still compute the maximum area.\n\n8. **Large Variation in Heights**:\n   - **Input**: `height = [0, 10000, 0, 5000, 0]`\n   - **Description**: A case with significant variation in heights.

The expected output should be `0` since there are no characters to form any substrings.\n\n2. **Single Character String**\n   - **Input:** `text = \"a\"`\n   - **Description:** This tests the case where the input string has only one character. The expected output should be `1` since the single character is a palindrome itself.\n\n3. **Two Identical Characters**\n   - **Input:** `text = \"aa\"`\n   - **Description:** This tests the case where the string consists of two identical characters. The expected output should be `1` since it can be split into one chunk of \"aa\".\n\n4. **Two Different Characters**\n   - **Input:** `text = \"ab\"`\n   - **Description:** This tests the case where the string consists of two different characters. The expected output should be `1` since it cannot be split into palindromic chunks.\n\n5. **Maximum Length with Repeated Patterns**\n   - **Input:** `text = \"abcdeedcbaabcdeedcba\"`\n   - **Description:** This tests the performance edge case with a maximum length string that can be decomposed into multiple palindromic chunks. The expected output should be `10` as it can be split into `(\"abcdeedcba\")` repeated twice.\n\n6. **Long String with No Palindromic Structure**\n   - **Input:** `text = \"abcdefghijklmno\"`\n   - **Description:** This tests the case where the string has no palindromic structure. The expected output should be `1` since it cannot be split into any meaningful chunks.\n\n7. **Complex Palindromic Structure**\n   - **Input:** `text = \"abcbaabccbaabcba\"`\n   - **Description:** This tests a complex case where the string has multiple palindromic sections. The expected output should be `7` as it can be split into `(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"ba\", \"bc\", \"b\", \"a\")`.\n\n8. **String with Maximum Length of Identical Characters**\n   - **Input:** `text = \"aaaaaaaaaa\"` (length = 10)\n   - **Description:** This tests the performance edge case with a long string of identical characters. The expected output should be `5` since it can be split into `(\"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"a\")`.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios that include edge cases for empty inputs, single characters, maximum lengths, and various palindromic structures."

The expected output should be `1`, as one operation is needed to remove that element.\n\n3. **Single Element Greater than x**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [10], x = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the array contains a single element that is greater than `x`. The expected output should be `-1`, as it is impossible to reduce `x` to zero.\n\n4. **All Elements Greater than x**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [6, 7, 8], x = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests a scenario where all elements in the array are greater than `x`. The expected output should be `-1`.\n\n5. **Exact Match with Multiple Elements**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x = 6`\n   - **Description**: Tests a scenario where multiple combinations of elements can sum to `x`.

The expected output should be an empty array since there are no elements to return.\n\n2. **Single Element Array**:\n   - Input: `arr = [5], k = 1, x = 3`\n   - Description: Tests the case where the array contains only one element. The output should be `[5]`, as it is the only available element.\n\n3. **All Elements are the Same**:\n   - Input: `arr = [2, 2, 2, 2], k = 2, x = 3`\n   - Description: Tests how the function handles an array with all identical elements. The output should be `[2, 2]`, as all elements are equally close to `x`.\n\n4. **K Equals Array Length**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7], k = 4, x = 6`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario where `k` is equal to the length of the array.

The expected output should be `[-1, 2, -3]`, as these are the three closest to `0`.\n\n6. **X is Less Than All Elements**:\n   - Input: `arr = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2, x = 5`\n   - Description: Tests the case where `x` is less than the smallest element in the array. The expected output should be the first two elements `[10, 20]`.\n\n7. **X is Greater Than All Elements**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2, x = 10`\n   - Description: Tests the case where `x` is greater than the largest element in the array. The expected output should be the last two elements `[3, 4]`.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case**:\n   - Input: `arr = [i for i in range(-10000, 10000)], k = 10000, x = 0`\n   - Description: Tests the upper limits of the constraints with a large array size.

        "",
        "Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\n\nFor example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:\n\nThe test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\n\nNote that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\n\nCustom Judge:\n\nThe inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):\n\n\n\tintersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\n\tlistA - The first linked list.\n\tlistB - The second linked list.\n\tskipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n\tskipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n\n\nThe judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\nOutput: Intersected at &#39;8&#39;\nExplanation: The intersected node&#39;s value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n- Note that the intersected node&#39;s value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\nOutput: Intersected at &#39;2&#39;\nExplanation: The intersected node&#39;s value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2\nOutput: No intersection\nExplanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\nExplanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes of listA is in the m.\n\tThe number of nodes of listB is in the n.\n\t1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104\n\t1 <= Node.val <= 105\n\t0 <= skipA <= m\n\t0 <= skipB <= n\n\tintersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.\n\tintersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nFollow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?"

This tests the function's ability to handle the absence of nodes.\n\n2. **One List Empty**:\n   - Input: `intersectVal = 0`, `listA = [1, 2, 3]`, `listB = []`, `skipA = 0`, `skipB = 0`\n   - Description: One list is non-empty while the other is empty. This checks if the function correctly identifies that there is no intersection.\n\n3. **Single Node Intersection**:\n   - Input: `intersectVal = 1`, `listA = [1]`, `listB = [1]`, `skipA = 0`, `skipB = 0`\n   - Description: Both lists consist of a single node that intersects. This tests the simplest case of intersection.\n\n4. **Multiple Nodes with Intersection at the Last Node**:\n   - Input: `intersectVal = 5`, `listA = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `listB = [6, 7, 5]`, `skipA = 4`, `skipB = 2`\n   - Description: The intersection occurs at the last node of both lists.

This tests the function's ability to handle lists of varying sizes without intersections.\n\n6. **Intersection at the Head of Both Lists**:\n   - Input: `intersectVal = 10`, `listA = [10, 20, 30]`, `listB = [10, 40, 50]`, `skipA = 0`, `skipB = 0`\n   - Description: The intersection occurs at the head of both lists.
