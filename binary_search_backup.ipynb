    "",
    "### Approach:",
    "",
    "1. **Understanding the Problem**:",
    "   - The fractions we can form are of the kind `arr[i] / arr[j]` where `0 <= i < j < arr.length`.",
    "   - We need to find the K-th smallest fraction from these possible fractions.",
    "",
    "2. **Binary Search on the Fraction**:",
    "   - Instead of generating all possible fractions and sorting them (which would be O(n^2)), we can utilize binary search on the possible values of fractions.",
    "   - The smallest fraction will be `1 / arr[-1]` (when `i = 0` and `j` is the last index), and the largest fraction will be `arr[-2] / arr[-1]` (when `i` is the second last index and `j` is the last index).",
    "",
    "3. **Counting Fractions**:",
    "   - For a mid-value (which is a candidate for the K-th smallest fraction), we can determine how many fractions are less than or equal to this value.",
    "   - Use two pointers: one for the numerator and one for the denominator. For each numerator, move the denominator pointer to count how many valid fractions are less than or equal to the candidate value.",
    "",
    "4. **Adjusting the Search Space**:",
    "   - If the count of fractions less than or equal to the mid-value is less than K, it means we need to look for larger fractions (move the lower bound up).",
    "   - If it is greater than or equal to K, we adjust the upper bound down to search for potentially smaller fractions.",
    "",
    "5. **Finding the Actual K-th Fraction**:",

The expected behavior should be defined (e.g., return 0, an error, or a specific value).\n\n2. **Single Element Array**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [5]`, `target = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest case where the array has only one element that equals the target. The output should be the element itself.\n\n3. **Single Element Greater than Target**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [10]`, `target = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the single element is greater than the target. The function should return the target since the only element must be capped.\n\n4. **All Elements Equal**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [3, 3, 3]`, `target = 8`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where all elements are the same and the target is greater than the sum of the array. The output should be the same element since it cannot exceed that value.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Array with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [1] * 10^4`, `target = 10^5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and correctness of the solution with the maximum array size and all elements being the same. The output should be 1 since the sum cannot exceed the total number of elements.\n\n6. **Target Less than Minimum Element**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [10, 20, 30]`, `target = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where the target is less than the minimum element in the array. The expected output should be the target itself.\n\n7. **Target Greater than Sum of Elements**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, `target = 10`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the target is greater than the sum of all elements in the array. The output should be the maximum element since capping at that value will yield the closest sum.\n\n8. **Negative Target**:\n   - **Input**: `arr = [5, 10, 15]`, `target = -5`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles a negative target value. The expected behavior should be defined (e.g., return 0, the minimum of the array, or a specific value).\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations that are crucial"

    "   - For any integer `x`, if we replace all elements in `arr` that are greater than `x` with `x`, the modified array will sum to a value that can be computed easily. ",

    "   - To find the optimal `x`, we can use binary search. The reason for this is that as `x` increases, the sum of the modified array decreases monotonically. This means that if for some `x`, the sum is less than the target, increasing `x` will either bring us closer to or further from the target.",

The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark.

The second train ride takes 3/3 = 1 hour.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 2 hour mark. The third train takes 2/3 = 0.66667 hours.\n- You will arrive at the 2.66667 hour mark.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible because the earliest the third train can depart is at the 2 hour mark.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == dist.length\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t1 <= dist[i] <= 105\n\t1 <= hour <= 109\n\tThere will be at most two digits after the decimal point in hour.\n\n"

This checks the function's ability to identify impossible scenarios.\n\n3. **Multiple Train Rides, Exact Time**:\n   - **Input**: `dist = [1, 2, 3]`, `hour = 6`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with multiple train rides where the total time matches the hour exactly at a speed of 1 km/h.

    "1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the minimum integer speed `v` such that the total travel time across all train rides is less than or equal to `hour`. The travel time for each train ride is calculated as `time = distance / speed`. If the computed time is not an integer, we must round it up to the next whole number since we can only depart at integer hours.",

    "   - The lower bound (`low`) is `1` (minimum speed), and the upper bound (`high`) is `10^7`.",
    "",
    "3. **Calculating Total Time**:",
    "   - For each mid-point speed in our binary search, we will calculate the total time required to complete all train rides.",
    "   - For each train ride, if `dist[i] / mid` is not an integer, we round it up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil` or equivalent logic.",
    "",
    "4. **Binary Search Execution**:",
    "   - If the total time calculated at the current speed is less than or equal to `hour`, we can try a lower speed (move left in the search). If it's greater, we need a higher speed (move right in the search).",
    "",

    "",
    "1. **Understanding a Peak Element**: A peak element is one that is greater than its adjacent neighbors (top, bottom, left, right). Since the matrix is surrounded by a perimeter of -1s, we don't need to handle edge cases for out-of-bounds errors.",

    "   - For each selected row, find the column index of the maximum element in that row.",
    "   - Check if this maximum element is a peak:",
    "     - If it is greater than its neighbors (considering the surrounding perimeter), return its coordinates.",
    "     - If it is not a peak, determine which direction to go (up or down) by comparing the maximum element with its vertical neighbors (the elements directly above and below in the next rows).",
    "",

    "   - If the element above is greater than the current maximum, it indicates that we should search in the upper half of the matrix.",
    "   - If the element below is greater, we should search in the lower half.",

The function should return 1.\n\n2. **All Versions Good (n = 5, bad = 6)**:\n   - Input: `n = 5`, `bad = 6` (assuming bad version exceeds n)\n   - This tests the case where all versions are good, and the bad version is out of bounds. The function should handle this gracefully, ideally returning `n + 1` or an indication that no bad version exists.\n\n3. **First Version Bad (n = 5, bad = 1)**:\n   - Input: `n = 5`, `bad = 1`\n   - This tests the scenario where the first version is bad. The function should return 1 immediately.\n\n4. **Last Version Bad (n = 5, bad = 5)**:\n   - Input: `n = 5`, `bad = 5`\n   - This tests the case where the last version is bad.

The function should correctly identify the first bad version as 7.\n\n8. **Multiple Calls to API (Simulating)**:\n   - Input: `n = 10`, `bad = 4`\n   - This tests the efficiency of the implementation by simulating multiple calls to the API. The function should minimize the number of calls while still returning the correct first bad version.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, performance considerations, and special cases that could affect the implementation of the solution."

    "### Approach Explanation",

    "1. **Binary Search**: Since the array is sorted, we can effectively use binary search to locate the single element. The key observation is that pairs of identical integers will always have the first occurrence at an even index and the second occurrence at the next odd index. If we find a pair that is not aligned this way, we can conclude that the single element must be on the left side (before the pair) or on the right side (after the pair).",
