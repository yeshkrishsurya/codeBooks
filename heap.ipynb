The output should be the same as the input list.\n\n4. **Multiple Lists with Varying Lengths**:\n   - **Input**: `lists = [[1, 4], [2, 3, 5], [0]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests merging lists of different lengths. The output should be a single sorted list combining all elements.\n\n5. **Lists with Duplicate Values**:\n   - **Input**: `lists = [[1, 1, 2], [1, 3, 4], [2, 2, 6]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the algorithm handles duplicate values across different lists.

The output should be a sorted list that correctly orders these values.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Lists**:\n   - **Input**: `lists = [[1]*500] * 20` (20 lists of 500 elements each, all being 1)\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm with the maximum constraints. The output should be a list of 10,000 elements, all being 1.\n\n8. **Lists with Mixed Values and Lengths**:\n   - **Input**: `lists = [[-1, 0, 1], [3, 4], [2], [], [5, 6, 7]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a more complex scenario with a mix of positive, negative, and zero values, as well as an empty list.

        "Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.\n\nGiven an integer array rains where:\n\n\n\trains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.\n\trains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.\n\n\nReturn an array ans where:\n\n\n\tans.length == rains.length\n\tans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.\n\tans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.\n\n\nIf there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.\n\nNotice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: rains = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [-1,-1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]\nAfter the second day full lakes are [1,2]\nAfter the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]\nAfter the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]\nThere&#39;s no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]\nOutput: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]\nAfter the second day full lakes are [1,2]\nAfter the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]\nAfter the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.\nAfter the fifth day, full lakes are [2].\nAfter the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].\nIt is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.\nAfter that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It&#39;s easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= rains.length <= 105\n\t0 <= rains[i] <= 109\n\n"

The expected output should be `[-1, -1, -1, -1]` as there are no opportunities to dry any lakes.\n\n2. **Multiple Dry Days with No Floods**:\n   - **Input**: `rains = [1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: This case checks if the function can correctly handle multiple dry days and avoid floods by drying lakes strategically. The output can be `[-1, -1, 2, 1, -1, -1]` or any valid combination.\n\n3. **Immediate Flood Scenario**:\n   - **Input**: `rains = [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`\n   - **Description**: This case tests a situation where no matter which lake is dried on the dry day, a flood is inevitable. The expected output is `[]`.\n\n4. **Single Lake with Rain**:\n   - **Input**: `rains = [1]`\n   - **Description**: This edge case tests the smallest possible input where there is only one day of rain. The expected output should be `[-1]`.\n\n5. **Single Dry Day with Rain Before and After**:\n   - **Input**: `rains = [1, 0, 1]`\n   - **Description**: This case tests the ability to dry a lake when there is only one opportunity. The expected output could be `[-1, 1, -1]` if lake 1 is dried.\n\n6. **All Dry Days**:\n   - **Input**: `rains = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the scenario where there are no rains at all. The output should be an array of any valid lake numbers, e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `rains = [1] * 100000`\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum allowed size of the input array where it rains every day. The expected output should be an array of `[-1]` repeated 100,000 times.\n\n8. **Large Values with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `rains = [1000000000, 1000000000, 0, 1000000000]`\n   - **"

This tests the algorithm's ability to handle the scenario where all numbers need to be multiplied to become even.\n\n3. **All Even Numbers**:\n   - Input: `nums = [2, 4, 6, 8]`\n   - Description: An array consisting entirely of even numbers. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle the scenario where all numbers need to be divided to minimize deviation.\n\n4. **Large Numbers**:\n   - Input: `nums = [10^9, 10^9 - 1, 10^9 - 2]`\n   - Description: An array with very large integers. This tests the algorithm's performance and correctness with maximum input values.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, ..., 50000]` (an array of size 50,000)\n   - Description: Tests the algorithm's efficiency and performance with the maximum allowed size of the input array.\n\n6. **Mixed Odd and Even Numbers**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - Description: An array containing a mix of odd and even numbers.

        "You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei] denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or\r\n\t1 if it is a batch of sell orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.\r\n\r\nThere is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIf the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order&#39;s price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order&#39;s price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.\r\n\tVice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order&#39;s price is larger than or equal to the current sell order&#39;s price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the backlog.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nExample 1:\r\n\r\n\r\nInput: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]\r\nOutput: 6\r\nExplanation: Here is what happens with the orders:\r\n- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.\r\n- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.\r\n- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.\r\n- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.\r\nFinally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n\r\n\r\nInput: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]\r\nOutput: 999999984\r\nExplanation: Here is what happens with the orders:\r\n- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.\r\n- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.\r\n- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.\r\n- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.\r\nFinally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nConstraints:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t1 <= orders.length <= 105\r\n\torders[i].length == 3\r\n\t1 <= pricei, amounti <= 109\r\n\torderTypei is either 0 or 1.\r\n"

Tests if the CPU correctly chooses the task with the shortest processing time first, leading to an output of `[2, 1, 0]`.\n\n3. **All Tasks with Same Processing Time**:\n   - Input: `tasks = [[1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5]]`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario where all tasks have the same processing time but different enqueue times. The output should reflect the order of enqueue times: `[0, 1, 2]`.\n\n4. **Tasks with Varying Enqueue Times and Processing Times**:\n   - Input: `tasks = [[1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 3], [4, 2]]`\n   - Description: Tests a mix of enqueue and processing times to ensure the CPU selects tasks correctly based on the rules.

The expected output should be `[0, 1, 2]`, as the CPU will be idle until task 1 is available.\n\n8. **Tasks with Zero Processing Time**:\n   - Input: `tasks = [[1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 2]]`\n   - Description"

This tests the robustness of the unreserve function and ensures it does not crash or produce incorrect behavior.\n\n7. **Sequential Reserve and Unreserve**:\n   - **Input**: `SeatManager(5); for i in range(5): reserve(); for i in range(5): unreserve(i+1);`\n   - **Description**: Reserve all seats in sequence and then unreserve them in the same order. This tests the basic functionality of the system under normal conditions.\n\n8. **Interleaved Operations**:\n   - **Input**: `SeatManager(5); reserve(); unreserve(1); reserve(); reserve(); unreserve(2); reserve();`\n   - **Description**: Perform a mix of reserve and unreserve operations in a non-linear fashion to ensure the system can handle interleaved operations correctly.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios,"

This checks if the implementation correctly assigns tasks based on the server index when weights are tied.\n\n4. **Tasks Longer than Server Processing Time**:\n   - **Input**: `servers = [1, 2]`, `tasks = [3, 3, 3]`\n   - **Description**: All tasks take longer to process than the time it takes for the servers to become free. This tests the handling of task queuing and server availability.\n\n5. **All Tasks Have the Same Duration**:\n   - **Input**: `servers = [2, 3, 1]`, `tasks = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n   - **Description**: All tasks require the same processing time. This checks if the algorithm prioritizes servers correctly based on weight and index.\n\n6. **Maximum Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `servers = [1] * 200000`, `tasks = [1] * 200000`\n   - **Description**: Test with the maximum constraints to evaluate performance and ensure the solution can handle large inputs without timing out or running into memory issues.\n\n7. **Immediate Server Availability**:\n   - **Input**: `servers = [1, 2, 3]`, `tasks = [1, 1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: Each task is short enough that servers become available immediately after completing the previous task. This tests the rapid reassignment of tasks.\n\n8. **Tasks Arriving After All Servers are Busy**:\n   - **Input**: `servers = [2, 3]`, `tasks = [3, 3, 3, 3]`\n   - **Description**: The first two tasks occupy the servers, and the subsequent tasks must wait. This checks the queuing mechanism and ensures that tasks are assigned correctly when servers"

The expected output should be `0` after removing the only stone.\n\n2. **Single Pile, Multiple Operations**:\n   - **Input**: `piles = [10], k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the behavior when multiple operations are performed on a single pile.

The second largest element should be -2.\n\n4. **Array with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `nums = [3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5], k = 3`\n   - Description: Tests the presence of duplicates in the array.

This tests how the function handles cases where no pairs can be formed.\n\n2. **Single Element Arrays**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [5], nums2 = [10], k = 1`\n   - Description: Each array contains only one element. This tests the function's ability to handle the simplest non-empty case.\n\n3. **Maximum Size Arrays**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [1, 2, ..., 100000], nums2 = [1, 2, ..., 100000], k = 10000`\n   - Description: Both arrays are at their maximum length (100,000). This tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm under large input sizes.\n\n4. **All Elements are Zero**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [0, 0, 0], nums2 = [0, 0, 0], k = 3`\n   - Description: All elements in both arrays are zero. This checks if the function can handle cases where the sums are the same.\n\n5. **Negative and Positive Numbers**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [-1, 0, 1], nums2 = [-1, 0, 1], k = 5`\n   - Description: The arrays contain both negative and positive numbers. This tests how the function handles pairs that can yield negative sums.\n\n6. **Duplicates in Arrays**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [1, 1, 2], nums2 = [1, 2, 3], k = 3`\n   - Description: The first array has duplicate elements. This checks if the function correctly handles and counts duplicate pairs.\n\n7. **k Greater than Possible Pairs**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4], k = 5`\n   - Description: The value of k exceeds the number of possible pairs (4 in this case). This tests how the function behaves when asked for more pairs than available.\n\n8. **Large k with Small Arrays**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4], k = 2`\n   - Description: The arrays are small, but k is set to the maximum number of pairs available. This tests if the function can return all possible pairs correctly. \n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive test of the solution's robustness."

        "### Approach Explanation",
        "",
        "1. **Understanding the Matrix**: The matrix is sorted both row-wise and column-wise. This means that the smallest element is at the top-left corner (matrix[0][0]), and larger elements are found as we move right or down.",

        "   - We can utilize a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements in the matrix.",
        "   - We start by adding the first element of each row to the heap. This is because the smallest elements will either be in the first row or the first column.",
        "   - We then repeatedly extract the minimum element from the heap, and for each extracted element, we add the next element in the same column (if it exists) to the heap.",
        "   - We do this until we extract the kth smallest element.",
        "",
        "3. **Heap Operations**:",
        "   - Inserting and extracting from a heap takes O(log k) time, where k is the number of elements in the heap. Since we will extract k elements, the overall time complexity will be O(k log k).",

The expected output should be `0` since there are no cells to trap water.\n\n2. **Single Element Matrix**:\n   - Input: `heightMap = [[5]]`\n   - Description: Tests the smallest non-empty matrix. The expected output should be `0` because a single cell cannot trap any water.\n\n3. **Flat Surface**:\n   - Input: `heightMap = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]`\n   - Description: Tests a flat surface where all cells are of equal height. The expected output should be `0` as there are no depressions to trap water.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Matrix with Uniform Height**:\n   - Input: `heightMap = [[1] * 200] * 200`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum constraints where all heights are the same. The expected output should be `0`.\n\n5. **Matrix with a Single Pit**:\n   - Input: `heightMap = [[3, 3, 3], [3, 1, 3], [3, 3, 3]]`\n   - Description: Tests a simple case where there is a single pit in the center. The expected output should be `2`, as the pit can hold 2 units of water.\n\n6. **Matrix with Multiple Pits**:\n   - Input: `heightMap = [[1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2], [3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1]]`\n   - Description: Tests a more complex elevation map with multiple pits. The expected output should be `4`, as described in the problem statement.\n\n7. **Matrix with Varying Heights**:\n   - Input: `heightMap = [[1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1]]`\n   - Description: Tests a case with varying heights that can trap water. The expected output should be `4`, as the center can hold 4 units of water.\n\n8. **Matrix with Edge Values**:\n   - Input: `heightMap = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]`\n   - Description: Tests the edge case where all heights are zero. The expected output should be `0`, as there are no elevations to trap water.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations."
