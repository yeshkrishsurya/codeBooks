The output should group the duplicates together.\n\n4. **All Anagrams**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"cba\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where all strings are anagrams of each other. The output should contain a single group with all strings.\n\n5. **No Anagrams**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"abc\", \"def\", \"ghi\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where none of the strings are anagrams. The output should have each string in its own group.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"a\" * 100] * 10000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance with the maximum constraints, where all strings are identical. The output should contain a single group with 10,000 identical strings.\n\n7. **Mixed Length Strings**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"abc\", \"cba\", \"bac\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with varying string lengths, where some strings are anagrams of others. The output should group the anagrams correctly.\n\n8. **Case Sensitivity**:\n   - **Input**: `strs = [\"a\", \"A\", \"b\", \"B\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the handling of case sensitivity (if applicable).

The expected output should be `5`, as the longest consecutive sequence is `[-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`.\n\n5. **Array with Large Range of Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1000000000, 999999999, 999999998, 999999997]`\n   - Description: Tests the algorithm's performance with large integers.

Ensure the correct value is returned.\n   - Input: `myHashMap.put(1, 10); myHashMap.get(1);`\n   - Expected Output: `10`\n\n3. **Updating Existing Key**:\n   - Insert a key-value pair, update the value for the same key, and confirm that the updated value is returned.\n   - Input: `myHashMap.put(1, 10); myHashMap.put(1, 20); myHashMap.get(1);`\n   - Expected Output: `20`\n\n4. **Removing an Existing Key**:\n   - Insert a key-value pair, remove the key, and ensure that subsequent retrieval returns -1.\n   - Input: `myHashMap.put(1, 10); myHashMap.remove(1); myHashMap.get(1);`\n   - Expected Output: `-1`\n\n5. **Removing a Non-Existent Key**:\n   - Attempt to remove a key that does not exist in the HashMap and ensure that it does not affect the existing keys.\n   - Input: `myHashMap.put(1, 10); myHashMap.remove(2); myHashMap.get(1);`\n   - Expected Output: `10`\n\n6. **Handling Maximum Key and Value**:\n   - Test the insertion of the maximum allowed key and value (1,000,000) to ensure the implementation can handle upper limits.\n   - Input: `myHashMap.put(1000000, 1000000); myHashMap.get(1000000);`\n   - Expected Output: `1000000`\n\n7. **Handling Duplicate Keys**:\n   - Insert the same key multiple times with different values and check that the last value is retained.\n   - Input: `myHashMap.put(1, 10); myHashMap.put(1, 20); myHashMap.put(1, 30); myHashMap.get(1);`\n   - Expected Output: `30`\n\n8. **Performance with Maximum Calls**:\n   - Simulate the maximum number of operations (10,000) to test performance and ensure no errors occur under load.

This checks if the function can handle large numbers correctly and returns all subdomains.\n\n3. **Multiple Domains with Overlapping Subdomains**:\n   - **Input**: `cpdomains = [\"9001 discuss.leetcode.com\", \"1001 leetcode.com\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the aggregation of counts for overlapping subdomains. The expected output should correctly sum visits for \"leetcode.com\" and \"com\".\n\n4. **Single Domain with Zero Visits**:\n   - **Input**: `cpdomains = [\"0 example.com\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles a domain with zero visits.

Expected output should be an empty list.\n\n2. **Single Element Wordlist with Exact Match**:\n   - **Input**: `wordlist = [\"apple\"]`, `queries = [\"apple\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest case where the query matches the wordlist exactly. Expected output should be `[\"apple\"]`.\n\n3. **Single Element Wordlist with Case Sensitivity**:\n   - **Input**: `wordlist = [\"Apple\"]`, `queries = [\"apple\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests case insensitivity. The expected output should be `[\"Apple\"]` since it matches the word in the wordlist ignoring case.\n\n4. **Single Element Wordlist with Vowel Error**:\n   - **Input**: `wordlist = [\"bat\"]`, `queries = [\"bet\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the vowel error handling. The expected output should be `[\"bat\"]` since changing 'e' to 'a' matches the word in the wordlist.\n\n5. **Multiple Matches with Different Cases**:\n   - **Input**: `wordlist = [\"hello\", \"Hello\", \"HELLO\"]`, `queries = [\"HELLO\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case sensitivity and precedence rules. The expected output should be `[\"HELLO\"]` since it matches exactly.\n\n6. **Vowel Replacement Leading to No Match**:\n   - **Input**: `wordlist = [\"kite\"]`, `queries = [\"kote\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where a vowel error does not lead to a match. The expected output should be `[\"\"]` since there are no matches.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `wordlist = [\"word\"] * 5000`, `queries = [\"word\"] * 5000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the function with the maximum constraints. Expected output should be a list of 5000 \"word\".\n\n8. **Queries with Vowel Errors Leading to Different Matches**:\n   - **Input**: `wordlist = [\"cat\", \"bat\", \"hat\"]`, `queries = [\"cot\", \"bat\", \"hat\", \"cat\"]`\n   - **Description**: Tests various scenarios where queries have vowel errors and exact matches. The expected output should be `[\"cat\", \"bat\", \"hat\", \"cat\"]`.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios including empty inputs, exact matches, case sensitivity, vowel errors, and performance under maximum constraints."

Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.\n\nWhen a lamp is turned on, it illuminates its cell and all other cells in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nYou are also given another 2D array queries, where queries[j] = [rowj, colj]. For the jth query, determine whether grid[rowj][colj] is illuminated or not. After answering the jth query, turn off the lamp at grid[rowj][colj] and its 8 adjacent lamps if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with grid[rowj][colj].\n\nReturn an array of integers ans, where ans[j] should be 1 if the cell in the jth query was illuminated, or 0 if the lamp was not.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [1,0]\nExplanation: We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4].\nThe 0th&nbsp;query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.\n\nThe 1st&nbsp;query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [1,1]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[0,4]], queries = [[0,4],[0,1],[1,4]]\nOutput: [1,1,0]\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 109\n\t0 <= lamps.length <= 20000\n\t0 <= queries.length <= 20000\n\tlamps[i].length == 2\n\t0 <= rowi, coli < n\n\tqueries[j].length == 2\n\t0 <= rowj, colj < n\n\n"

The expected output should be `0` since there are no pairs to form.\n\n2. **Single Element**:\n   - **Input**: `time = [30]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where there is only one song. The expected output should be `0` since a pair cannot be formed.\n\n3. **Two Elements, No Valid Pair**:\n   - **Input**: `time = [10, 20]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where two songs do not form a valid pair. The expected output should be `0` since `(10 + 20) % 60 != 0`.\n\n4. **Two Elements, Valid Pair**:\n   - **Input**: `time = [30, 30]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where two identical songs form a valid pair. The expected output should be `1` since `(30 + 30) % 60 == 0`.\n\n5. **Maximum Size with No Valid Pairs**:\n   - **Input**: `time = [1] * (6 * 10**4)`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the input size with all elements being `1`. The expected output should be `0` since no pairs can be formed that are divisible by `60`.\n\n6. **Maximum Size with Valid Pairs**:\n   - **Input**: `time = [30] * (6 * 10**4)`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the input size with all elements being `30`. The expected output should be `1800000000` since all pairs of `30` will sum to `60`, and the number of pairs is given by the combination formula `nC2 = n(n-1)/2`.\n\n7. **Mixed Values with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `time = [10, 50, 20, 40, 30, 30, 30]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a mixed case with duplicates where some pairs are valid. The expected output should be `6`, as the valid pairs are `(10, 50)`, `(20, 40)`, and three pairs of `(30, 30)`.\n\n8. **All Elements are Multiples of 60**:\n   - **Input**: `time = [60, 120, 180, 240]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where all song durations are multiples of `60`.

The output should be an empty result set since there are no active users.\n\n2. **Single User, Single Activity**:\n   - Input: A table with one user and one activity on a single day (e.g., `user_id = 1`, `activity_date = '2019-07-20'`, `activity_type = 'open_session'`).\n   - Description: This checks if the solution correctly identifies a single active user on a specific day.\n\n3. **Multiple Activities by One User on One Day**:\n   - Input: A table with one user performing multiple activities on the same day (e.g., `user_id = 1`, with multiple rows for `activity_date = '2019-07-20'`).\n   - Description: This tests if the solution correctly counts the user as active only once for that day, regardless of the number of activities.\n\n4. **Multiple Users with Activities on Different Days**:\n   - Input: A table with multiple users, each having activities on different days within the 30-day range.\n   - Description: This checks if the solution correctly counts the active users for each day when users are active on different days.\n\n5. **Users Active on Overlapping Days**:\n   - Input: A table where multiple users have activities on overlapping days (e.g., `user_id = 1` active on `2019-07-20`, `user_id = 2` active on `2019-07-20` and `2019-07-21`).\n   - Description: This tests if the solution accurately counts the number of unique active users for each day.\n\n6. **All Users Active on the Same Day**:\n   - Input: A table where all users have activities on the same day (e.g., multiple users with activities on `2019-07-20`).\n   - Description: This checks if the solution can handle a scenario where all users are active on the same day and returns the correct count.\n\n7. **Activities Outside the 30-Day Range**:\n   - Input: A table with activities that fall outside the specified 30-day range (e.g., activities dated `2019-06-15` or `2019-07-28`).\n   - Description: This tests if the solution correctly ignores activities that are outside the specified date range and only counts those within the last 30 days.\n\n8. **Duplicate Rows**:\n   - Input: A table with duplicate rows for the same user and activity on the same day (e.g., multiple identical entries for `user_id = 1`, `activity_date = '2019-07-"

It checks if the function can handle the minimum constraints correctly.\n\n2. **All Unique Group Sizes**:\n   - **Input**: `groupSizes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - **Description**: Each person has a unique group size. This tests the algorithm's ability to correctly assign groups when group sizes vary significantly.\n\n3. **All Same Group Size**:\n   - **Input**: `groupSizes = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`\n   - **Description**: All individuals belong to the same group size. This checks if the function can handle uniform group sizes and form the correct number of groups.\n\n4. **Multiple Valid Group Combinations**:\n   - **Input**: `groupSizes = [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: This input has multiple valid group combinations. It tests if the function can produce any valid grouping that satisfies the conditions.\n\n5. **Maximum Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `groupSizes = [1] * 500`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the input size with all individuals needing to be in groups of size 1. This checks for performance and correctness at maximum constraints.\n\n6. **Large Groups with Small Individuals**:\n   - **Input**: `groupSizes = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1]`\n   - **Description**: This tests the scenario where most individuals belong to large groups while a few belong to smaller groups.

This will check if the query correctly returns an empty result set.\n   - **Expected Output**: An empty result.\n\n2. **Single Product with Exact 100 Units Ordered**:\n   - **Description**: Include a scenario where a single product has exactly 100 units ordered in February 2020. This tests the boundary condition of the minimum required units.\n   - **Expected Output**: The product name and 100 units.\n\n3. **Single Product with Less than 100 Units Ordered**:\n   - **Description**: Include a scenario where a single product has a total of less than 100 units ordered in February 2020. This checks if the query correctly excludes products that do not meet the threshold.\n   - **Expected Output**: An empty result.\n\n4. **Multiple Orders for the Same Product**:\n   - **Description**: Test with multiple entries in the Orders table for a single product that together exceed 100 units ordered. This checks if the aggregation of units is handled correctly.\n   - **Expected Output**: The product name and the total units ordered (greater than 100).\n\n5. **Products with Duplicate Orders**:\n   - **Description**: Include duplicate rows in the Orders table for the same product and date. This checks if the query correctly aggregates the units without counting duplicates multiple times.\n   - **Expected Output**: The product name and the correct total units ordered.\n\n6. **Products with Different Categories**:\n   - **Description**: Test with products from different categories to ensure that the query does not filter based on product categories and correctly aggregates units across categories.\n   - **Expected Output**: All qualifying products regardless of their categories.\n\n7. **Maximum Size of Orders Table**:\n   - **Description**: Simulate a large Orders table with a high number of entries (e.g., thousands of rows) to test the performance and efficiency of the query.\n   - **Expected Output**: Correctly aggregated results for products with at least 100 units ordered, ensuring that performance is acceptable.\n\n8. **Products with No Orders at All**:\n   - **Description**: Include products in the Products table that have no corresponding entries in the Orders table. This tests if the query correctly identifies and excludes products without orders.\n   - **Expected Output**: Only the products that have orders with at least 100 units should be returned, excluding those with no orders.\n\nThese edge cases will help ensure that the solution is robust, handles various scenarios, and performs well under different conditions."

This checks if the solution correctly identifies that `0` is double `0` but ensures it respects the index condition (i != j).\n\n3. **Negative and Positive Values**:\n   - Input: `arr = [-2, -1, 1, 2]`\n   - Description: An array containing both negative and positive numbers.

This tests the performance of the solution with large input sizes.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Array with No Valid Pair**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1] + [3] * 498 + [5]`\n   - Description: An array at the maximum size of 500 elements where no valid pairs exist.

Every nth customer paying for their groceries will be given a percentage discount. The discount amount is given by discount, where they will be given discount percent off their subtotal.

If the number of customers exceeds `n`, how should the discount be applied? Is it correct to assume that the discount only applies to every nth customer, and the discount count resets after reaching a customer who receives a discount?\n\n3. What should the system return if the subtotal calculation results in a negative value due to the discount? Should we assume that the discount percentage will never lead to a negative bill?\n\n4. Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints we should be aware of when implementing the `getBill` method, especially considering the maximum number of calls (1000) and the potential size of the input arrays?\n\n5.

Should the internal state of the `Cashier` class maintain the count of customers across multiple calls to `getBill`?"

This checks if the discount is applied correctly on the subtotal.\n\n5. **Multiple Products with Varying Quantities**:\n   - Input: `Cashier(2, 20, [1, 2, 3], [100, 200, 300])`, `getBill([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1])`\n   - Description: Test with multiple products and varying quantities. This checks if the subtotal calculation is accurate before applying the discount.\n\n6. **Large Input Values**:\n   - Input: `Cashier(10000, 50, [i for i in range(1, 201)], [i * 5 for i in range(1, 201)])`, `getBill([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000])`\n   - Description: Test with the maximum number of products (200) and a very high quantity for each product.

This checks if the basic functionality is working correctly.\n\n2. **Multiple Customers, Same Route**:\n   - Input: `checkIn(1, \"StationA\", 1); checkOut(1, \"StationB\", 5); checkIn(2, \"StationA\", 2); checkOut(2, \"StationB\", 6); getAverageTime(\"StationA\", \"StationB\");`\n   - Description: Tests multiple customers traveling the same route to ensure the average calculation is correct. Expected output should be `(4 + 4) / 2 = 4`.\n\n3. **Multiple Routes, Different Times**:\n   - Input: `checkIn(1, \"StationA\", 1); checkOut(1, \"StationB\", 5); checkIn(2, \"StationA\", 2); checkOut(2, \"StationC\", 7); getAverageTime(\"StationA\", \"StationB\"); getAverageTime(\"StationA\", \"StationC\");`\n   - Description: Tests the system's ability to handle different routes and ensure that averages are calculated independently for each route.\n\n4. **Check-In Without Check-Out**:\n   - Input: `checkIn(1, \"StationA\", 1); getAverageTime(\"StationA\", \"StationB\");`\n   - Description: Tests the behavior when a customer checks in but does not check out before querying the average time. This should not be a valid scenario based on the problem constraints.\n\n5. **Check-Out Without Check-In**:\n   - Input: `checkOut(1, \"StationB\", 5);`\n   - Description: Tests the behavior when a check-out is called without a corresponding check-in. This should also not be a valid scenario based on the problem constraints.\n\n6. **Maximum Capacity**:\n   - Input: `for (int i = 1; i <= 20000; i++) { checkIn(i, \"StationA\", i); checkOut(i, \"StationB\", i + 5); } getAverageTime(\"StationA\", \"StationB\");`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the system when the maximum number of calls is made. This checks if the implementation can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n7. **Same Station Check-In and Check-Out**:\n   - Input: `checkIn(1, \"StationA\", 1); checkOut(1, \"StationA\", 5); getAverageTime(\"StationA\", \"StationA"

Tests basic functionality with multiple connections.\n\n3. **Single Destination with Multiple Incoming Paths**:\n   - Input: `paths = [[\"A\", \"C\"], [\"B\", \"C\"], [\"D\", \"C\"]]`\n   - Description: Multiple cities lead to the same destination city \"C\". Ensures the function can handle multiple incoming paths correctly.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `paths = [[\"City\" + str(i), \"City\" + str(i + 1)] for i in range(99)]`\n   - Description: Tests the upper limit of the input size (100 paths). The output should be \"City99\".\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**:\n   - Input: `paths = [[\"a\", \"B\"], [\"B\", \"c\"], [\"c\", \"D\"]]`\n   - Description: Tests the function's ability to handle case-sensitive city names.

The output should be \"Chicago\".\n\n7. **Circular Path (Invalid Case)**:\n   - Input: `paths = [[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"B\", \"C\"], [\"C\", \"A\"]]`\n   - Description: Although the problem guarantees a linear path, testing an invalid circular path can help ensure that the implementation correctly identifies that the input should always be valid.\n\n8. **Empty Input**:\n   - Input: `paths = []`\n   - Description: Tests the behavior of the function when no paths are provided. Although the problem guarantees at least one path, itâs good to see how the function handles unexpected input.\n\nThese edge cases cover various scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a robust solution to the problem."

The output should be `[0]` since there are no other lists to compare against.\n\n2. **Multiple People with Unique Companies**:\n   - Input: `favoriteCompanies = [[\"a\"], [\"b\"], [\"c\"]]`\n   - Description: All lists contain unique companies. The output should be `[0, 1, 2]` since none of the lists are subsets of another.\n\n3. **All Lists are Subsets of the First List**:\n   - Input: `favoriteCompanies = [[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], [\"a\"], [\"b\"], [\"c\"]]`\n   - Description: All lists except the first are subsets of the first list. The output should be `[0]`.\n\n4. **Identical Lists with Different Indices**:\n   - Input: `favoriteCompanies = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"a\", \"b\"], [\"c\"]]`\n   - Description: Two identical lists and one unique list. The output should be `[2]` since the first two lists are subsets of each other.\n\n5. **Maximum Size with Distinct Companies**:\n   - Input: `favoriteCompanies = [[\"company\" + str(i) for i in range(500)]] * 100`\n   - Description: Test the maximum input size where all lists are identical and contain the maximum number of companies. The output should be `[]` since all lists are subsets of the first.\n\n6. **Nested Subsets**:\n   - Input: `favoriteCompanies = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"a\"], [\"b\", \"c\"], [\"c\"]]`\n   - Description: Some lists are subsets of others in a nested manner. The output should be `[0, 2, 3]` since the first list is not a subset of any other, and the others are not subsets of each other.\n\n7. **Completely Overlapping Lists**:\n   - Input: `favoriteCompanies = [[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], [\"a\", \"b\"]]`\n   - Description: Two identical lists and one that is a subset. The output should be `[0, 1]` since the first two lists are not subsets of each other.\n\n8. **Performance Edge Case with Large Distinct Inputs**:\n   - Input: `favoriteCompanies = [[\"company\" + str(i) for i in range(500)]] + [[\"company\" + str(i) for i in range(499)]] * 99`\n   - Description: One list with maximum companies and 99 lists that are subsets of it"

This tests the function's ability to handle empty inputs and should return `true` since an empty array can be formed from an empty set of pieces.\n\n2. **Single Element Match**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1]`, `pieces = [[1]]`\n   - Description: A simple case where `arr` contains a single element that matches a single piece. This tests the basic functionality of the algorithm.\n\n3. **Single Element No Match**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1]`, `pieces = [[2]]`\n   - Description: A case where `arr` has a single element that does not match the piece. This tests the algorithm's ability to identify mismatches.\n\n4. **Multiple Pieces with Correct Order**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, `pieces = [[1], [2], [3]]`\n   - Description: Each piece corresponds to an element in `arr` and is in the correct order. This tests the algorithm's ability to concatenate correctly ordered pieces.\n\n5. **Multiple Pieces with Incorrect Order**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, `pieces = [[2], [1], [3]]`\n   - Description: The pieces can form `arr`, but they are not in the correct order.

This checks for performance and efficiency.\n\n8. **Pieces with Overlapping Values**:\n   - Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `pieces = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]`\n   - Description: This tests the scenario where pieces have overlapping values, but cannot be concatenated to form `arr` due to the restriction on reordering.

Should the result be returned as a single integer, and are there any specific requirements for how to handle the modulo operation?\n\n4. Are there any edge cases we should consider, such as when the input array has fewer than two items or when all items are the same?\n\n5. What are the performance requirements for the solution? Specifically, what is the expected time complexity, and should we aim for a solution that works within certain constraints on the input size?"

Since the maximum value for any deliciousness is \\(2^{20}\\) (or 220), the relevant powers of two range from \\(2^0\\) to \\(2^{21}\\), which gives us a list: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576].",

For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire timeToLive seconds after the currentTime. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be extended to expire timeToLive seconds after the (potentially different) currentTime.\n\nImplement the AuthenticationManager class:\n\n\n\tAuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) constructs the AuthenticationManager and sets the timeToLive.\n\tgenerate(string tokenId, int currentTime) generates a new token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds.\n\trenew(string tokenId, int currentTime) renews the unexpired token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given tokenId, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.\n\tcountUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given currentTime.\n\n\nNote that if a token expires at time t, and another action happens on time t (renew or countUnexpiredTokens), the expiration takes place before the other actions.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput\n[&quot;AuthenticationManager&quot;, &quot;renew&quot;, &quot;generate&quot;, &quot;countUnexpiredTokens&quot;, &quot;generate&quot;, &quot;renew&quot;, &quot;renew&quot;, &quot;countUnexpiredTokens&quot;]\n[[5], [&quot;aaa&quot;, 1], [&quot;aaa&quot;, 2], [6], [&quot;bbb&quot;, 7], [&quot;aaa&quot;, 8], [&quot;bbb&quot;, 10], [15]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, 1, null, null, null, 0]\n\nExplanation\nAuthenticationManager authenticationManager = new AuthenticationManager(5); // Constructs the AuthenticationManager with timeToLive = 5 seconds.\nauthenticationManager.renew(&quot;aaa&quot;, 1); // No token exists with tokenId &quot;aaa&quot; at time 1, so nothing happens.\nauthenticationManager.generate(&quot;aaa&quot;, 2); // Generates a new token with tokenId &quot;aaa&quot; at time 2.\nauthenticationManager.countUnexpiredTokens(6); // The token with tokenId &quot;aaa&quot; is the only unexpired one at time 6, so return 1.\nauthenticationManager.generate(&quot;bbb&quot;, 7); // Generates a new token with tokenId &quot;bbb&quot; at time 7.\nauthenticationManager.renew(&quot;aaa&quot;, 8); // The token with tokenId &quot;aaa&quot; expired at time 7, and 8 >= 7, so at time 8 the renew request is ignored, and nothing happens.\nauthenticationManager.renew(&quot;bbb&quot;, 10); // The token with tokenId &quot;bbb&quot; is unexpired at time 10, so the renew request is fulfilled and now the token will expire at time 15.\nauthenticationManager.countUnexpiredTokens(15); // The token with tokenId &quot;bbb&quot; expires at time 15, and the token with tokenId &quot;aaa&quot; expired at time 7, so currently no token is unexpired, so return 0.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= timeToLive <= 108\n\t1 <= currentTime <= 108\n\t1 <= tokenId.length <= 5\n\ttokenId consists only of lowercase letters.\n\tAll calls to generate will contain unique values of tokenId.\n\tThe values of currentTime across all the function calls will be strictly increasing.\n\tAt most 2000 calls will be made to all functions combined.\n\n"

Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).\nThe user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\nSince both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4\nOutput: [1,1,0,0]\nExplanation:\nThe user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.\nThe user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\nThere is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.\nHence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= logs.length <= 104\n\t0 <= IDi <= 109\n\t1 <= timei <= 105\n\tk is in the range [The maximum UAM for a user, 105].\n\n"

The expected output should be an array of zeros since there are no users to count active minutes.\n\n2. **Single User, Single Action**:\n   - **Input**: `logs = [[1, 1]], k = 1`\n   - **Description**: Test with a single user performing one action. The expected output should be `[1]` since there is one user with UAM of 1.\n\n3. **Single User, Multiple Actions in Same Minute**:\n   - **Input**: `logs = [[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]], k = 1`\n   - **Description**: A single user performs multiple actions at the same minute. The expected output should be `[1]` since the UAM remains 1.\n\n4. **Multiple Users, All Unique Minutes**:\n   - **Input**: `logs = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]], k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Each user performs actions at different minutes. The expected output should be `[1, 1, 1]` since each user has a UAM of 1.\n\n5. **Multiple Users, Some Duplicate Minutes**:\n   - **Input**: `logs = [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 3]], k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Users have overlapping actions. The expected output should be `[0, 2, 1]` since user 1 has UAM of 2 and user 2 has UAM of 2.\n\n6. **Maximum Size of Logs**:\n   - **Input**: `logs = [[i, i % 100] for i in range(10000)], k = 100`\n   - **Description**: Test the upper limit of logs with 10,000 entries. This checks performance and handling of large input sizes. The expected output should reflect the distribution of UAMs based on the modulo operation.\n\n7. **All Users with Maximum UAM**:\n   - **Input**: `logs = [[i, j] for i in range(1, 6) for j in range(1, 6)], k = 5`\n   - **Description**: All users perform actions at all unique minutes (1 to 5).

Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie moviei.\n\nThe system should support the following functions:\n\n\n\tSearch: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.\n\tRent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.\n\tDrop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.\n\tReport: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list res where res[j] = [shopj, moviej] describes that the jth cheapest rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj.

The expected output should be an empty array.\n\n5. **Multiple Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]`, `nums2 = [2, 2]`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario with duplicates in both arrays. The output should reflect the minimum occurrence of duplicates, which is `[2, 2]`.\n\n6. **Different Sizes with Overlap**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [1, 2, 3]`, `nums2 = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n   - Description: Tests the case where the first array is smaller than the second and there are overlapping elements. The expected output should be `[2, 3]`.\n\n7. **All Elements Match**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [1, 1, 1]`, `nums2 = [1, 1, 1]`\n   - Description: Tests the case where both arrays contain the same elements with the same frequency. The output should be `[1, 1, 1]`.\n\n8. **Maximum Length Arrays with No Overlap**:\n   - Input: `nums1 = [0, 1, 2, ..., 999]`, `nums2 = [1000, 1001, 1002, ..., 1999]`\n   - Description: Tests the performance edge case where both arrays are at maximum length but have no overlapping elements. The expected output should be an empty array. \n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios including edge cases, boundary conditions, and performance considerations to ensure the robustness of the solution."

The expected output should be an empty list `[]`.\n\n2. **Single User, Multiple Tweets**:\n   - Input: \n     ```\n     postTweet(1, 1)\n     postTweet(1, 2)\n     postTweet(1, 3)\n     getNewsFeed(1)\n     ```\n   - Description: Test a single user posting multiple tweets. The expected output should be the list of all tweets posted by the user, ordered from most recent to least recent, i.e., `[3, 2, 1]`.\n\n3. **Following and Unfollowing**:\n   - Input: \n     ```\n     postTweet(1, 1)\n     postTweet(2, 2)\n     follow(1, 2)\n     getNewsFeed(1)\n     unfollow(1, 2)\n     getNewsFeed(1)\n     ```\n   - Description: Test the follow and unfollow functionality.

Ensure that the system can handle the upper limits efficiently. The expected output for `getNewsFeed(1)` should be the last 10 tweets from user 1, which would be `[1]` since user 1 only posted one tweet.\n\n6. **Follow Self Attempt**:\n   - Input: `follow(1, 1)`\n   - Description: Test the case where a user tries to follow themselves. The operation should be ignored, and no error should occur. Following this, `getNewsFeed(1)` should still return the user's own tweets.\n\n7. **Unfollow Non-Followed User**:\n   - Input: `unfollow(1, 2)`"

This should return `true` since a character can map to itself.\n\n4. **Different Lengths**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abc\"`, `t = \"ab\"`\n   - Description: The strings have different lengths. This should return `false` since isomorphic strings must have the same length.\n\n5. **Multiple Characters Mapping to One**:\n   - Input: `s = \"aab\"`, `t = \"xxy\"`\n   - Description: The first two characters in `s` map to the same character in `t`. This should return `true` since the mapping is consistent.\n\n6. **Conflicting Mappings**:\n   - Input: `s = \"foo\"`, `t = \"add\"`\n   - Description: The character 'o' in `s` would need to map to both 'a' and 'd' in `t`. This should return `false` due to conflicting mappings.\n\n7. **Large Input Size**:\n   - Input: `s = \"a\" * 50000`, `t = \"b\" * 50000`\n   - Description: Both strings consist of 50,000 identical characters. This should return `true` since all characters can map consistently.\n\n8. **Complex Mapping with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `s = \"abca\"`, `t = \"zxyw\"`\n   - Description: The first and last characters in `s` are the same, and they must map to the same character in `t`. This should return `false` since 'a' cannot map to both 'z' and 'w'.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios including empty inputs, single-character strings, length mismatches, and complex mappings, ensuring a comprehensive test of the isomorphic strings logic."

This tests the handling of empty inputs.\n\n2. **Single Character Pattern with Single Word**:\n   - **Input**: `pattern = \"a\"`, `s = \"dog\"`\n   - **Description**: A simple case where the pattern consists of a single character that should map to a single word. This checks the basic functionality of the mapping.\n\n3. **Single Character Pattern with Multiple Words**:\n   - **Input**: `pattern = \"a\"`, `s = \"dog cat\"`\n   - **Description**: The pattern has a single character but the string has multiple words. This should return false, testing the bijection requirement.\n\n4. **Pattern with All Unique Characters and Corresponding Unique Words**:\n   - **Input**: `pattern = \"abcd\"`, `s = \"dog cat fish bird\"`\n   - **Description**: Each character in the pattern maps to a unique word in the string. This tests the correct mapping of unique characters to unique words.\n\n5. **Pattern with Repeated Characters and Non-Matching Words**:\n   - **Input**: `pattern = \"aabb\"`, `s = \"dog cat dog fish\"`\n   - **Description**: The pattern has repeated characters, but the words do not match the required bijection. This tests the algorithm's ability to identify mismatches.\n\n6. **Pattern with All Same Characters and Different Words**:\n   - **Input**: `pattern = \"aaaa\"`, `s = \"dog cat fish bird\"`\n   - **Description**: The pattern consists of the same character, but the words are all different. This should return false, testing the requirement for unique word mapping.\n\n7. **Maximum Length Pattern and String**:\n   - **Input**: `pattern = \"a\" * 300`, `s = \" \".join([\"word\" + str(i) for i in range(300)])`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper boundary of the input sizes, where the pattern is at its maximum length and the string contains 300 unique words. This checks performance and handling of large inputs.\n\n8. **Pattern with Mixed Repeated and Unique Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `pattern = \"abac\"`, `s = \"dog cat dog fish\"`\n   - **Description**: This tests a more complex case where some characters are repeated while others are unique, and the corresponding words must reflect this structure. It checks the algorithm's ability to maintain the correct mapping.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including empty inputs, unique and repeated character mappings, and performance under maximum constraints."

The only possible index to return should be `0`.\n\n2. **All Elements are the Same**:\n   - Input: `[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5]]`\n   - Description: Test with an array where all elements are the same. The output should always be `0`, but it should also confirm that the random selection mechanism is functioning correctly.\n\n3. **Target is the First Element**:\n   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3, 1, 1], [1]]`\n   - Description: Test with multiple occurrences of the target at the beginning of the array. The output should randomly return one of the indices `0`, `3`, or `4`.\n\n4. **Target is the Last Element**:\n   - Input: `[[2, 3, 1, 2, 2], [2]]`\n   - Description: Test with multiple occurrences of the target at the end of the array. The output should randomly return one of the indices `0`, `3`, or `4`.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Array with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] * 4000, [3]]`\n   - Description: Test with the maximum allowed size of the array (20,000 elements) with duplicates. This checks the performance and correctness under maximum constraints.\n\n6. **Negative and Positive Numbers**:\n   - Input: `[[-1, 0, 1, -1, 1], [1]]`\n   - Description: Test with both negative and positive numbers in the array. The output should randomly return one of the indices `2` or `4`.\n\n7. **Multiple Calls to Pick**:\n   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3, 3, 3], [3], [3], [3]]`\n   - Description: Test multiple calls to `pick` for the same target to ensure that the random selection is working correctly and returning different indices over multiple calls.\n\n8. **Target is a Negative Number**:\n   - Input: `[[-5, -1, -5, 2, -5], [-5]]`\n   - Description: Test with negative numbers as the target. The output should randomly return one of the indices `0`, `2`, or `4`.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive testing approach for the solution."

The expected output is `0` since a boomerang requires at least three points.\n\n2. **Two Points**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with only two points. The expected output is `0` since a boomerang requires three points.\n\n3. **Three Collinear Points**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where three points are collinear. The expected output is `0` since no boomerangs can be formed.\n\n4. **Three Points Forming a Triangle**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where three points form a triangle. The expected output is `6` since each point can form two boomerangs with the other two points.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[i, j] for i in range(500) for j in range(500)]` (ensuring all points are unique)\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the solution with the maximum allowed number of points. This checks if the solution can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n6. **Negative Coordinates**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[-1, -1], [-2, -2], [-3, -3]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the handling of negative coordinates. The expected output is `0` since the points are collinear.\n\n7. **Points with Same Distance**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, -1], [2, 0]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where multiple points are equidistant from a common point. The expected output is `12` since each point can form multiple boomerangs with the others.\n\n8. **Points with Large Coordinate Values**:\n   - **Input**: `points = [[10000, 10000], [10001, 10000], [10000, 10001]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the handling of large coordinate values.

Otherwise, returns -1.\n\tvoid put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.\n\n\nTo determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.\n\nWhen a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.\n\nThe functions&nbsp;get&nbsp;and&nbsp;put&nbsp;must each run in O(1) average time complexity.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput\n[&quot;LFUCache&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;get&quot;]\n[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]\n\nExplanation\n// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x\n// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)\nLFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);\nlfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1\nlfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1\nlfu.get(1);      // return 1\n                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.\n&nbsp;                // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)\nlfu.get(3);      // return 3\n                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.\n                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2\nlfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)\nlfu.get(3);      // return 3\n                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3\nlfu.get(4);      // return 4\n                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= capacity&nbsp;<= 104\n\t0 <= key <= 105\n\t0 <= value <= 109\n\tAt most 2 * 105&nbsp;calls will be made to get and put.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;"

The expected output should be an empty result or a specific message indicating no customers exist.\n\n2. **Single Order by One Customer**:\n   - Input: Orders table with one entry (e.g., order_number = 1, customer_number = 1).\n   - Description: This tests the simplest case where there is only one order. The expected output should be the single customer (customer_number = 1).\n\n3. **Multiple Orders by Different Customers**:\n   - Input: Orders table with multiple customers but each having only one order (e.g., 3 customers with 1 order each).\n   - Description: This tests the scenario where no customer has more orders than another. The expected output should still return one of the customers, as the problem guarantees a unique maximum.\n\n4. **Multiple Orders by One Customer with Ties**:\n   - Input: Orders table where one customer has significantly more orders than others, but there is a tie for the second place (e.g., customer 1 has 3 orders, customer 2 and 3 each have 2).\n   - Description: This checks if the solution correctly identifies the customer with the highest number of orders when others have the same lower count.\n\n5. **Large Number of Orders**:\n   - Input: A large Orders table with thousands of entries (e.g., 10,000 entries) where one customer has a distinct maximum number of orders.\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the solution under a large dataset to ensure it executes efficiently.\n\n6. **Negative Customer Numbers**:\n   - Input: Orders table with negative customer numbers (e.g., order_number = 1, customer_number = -1).\n   - Description: This tests how the solution handles unexpected negative values in customer identifiers. The expected output should still correctly identify the customer with the most orders.\n\n7. **Duplicate Orders for the Same Customer**:\n   - Input: Orders table where the same order number is mistakenly assigned to the same customer multiple times (e.g., order_number = 1, customer_number = 1; order_number = 1, customer_number = 1).\n   - Description: This tests the solution's ability to handle duplicate entries and still return the correct customer with the maximum unique orders.\n\n8. **Maximum Integer Values**:\n   - Input: Orders table where order_number and customer_number are at their maximum integer values (e.g., order_number = 2147483647, customer_number = 2147483647).\n   - Description: This tests the solution's handling of maximum integer values to ensure it does not encounter overflow or other issues.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios that could affect"

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends\" problem:\n\n1. **Empty Table**:\n   - Input: An empty `RequestAccepted` table.\n   - Description: This tests the function's ability to handle a scenario with no data. The expected output should indicate no users have friends.\n\n2. **Single Request**:\n   - Input: A table with only one entry (e.g., `requester_id = 1`, `accepter_id = 2`).\n   - Description: This tests the function with the minimal non-empty input. The expected output should show the user with the most friends (in this case, user 2 with 1 friend).\n\n3. **Multiple Requests with One User Having Most Friends**:\n   - Input: A table with multiple entries where only one user has the most friends (e.g., `requester_id = 1, 1, 2`, `accepter_id = 2, 3, 3`).\n   - Description: This tests the basic functionality of counting friends. The expected output should correctly identify the user with the highest friend count.\n\n4. **Duplicate Requests**:\n   - Input: A table where the same friendship is accepted multiple times (e.g., `requester_id = 1, 1`, `accepter_id = 2, 2`).\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles duplicate entries. The expected output should still count unique friendships.\n\n5. **Multiple Users with Same Number of Friends**:\n   - Input: A table where multiple users have the same maximum number of friends (e.g., `requester_id = 1, 2, 3`, `accepter_id = 2, 3, 1`).\n   - Description: This tests the follow-up requirement where multiple users can have the same maximum friend count. The expected output should list all users with the maximum count.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: A large dataset approaching the maximum constraints (e.g., 10,000 entries).\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the solution under heavy load. The expected output should still be accurate and efficient.\n\n7. **Self-Friendship Requests**:\n   - Input: A table where a user sends a friend request to themselves (e.g., `requester_id = 1`, `accepter_id = 1`).\n   - Description: This tests how the function handles invalid friendships. The expected output should ignore self-friendships and not count them.\n\n8. **Non-consecutive Dates**:\n   - Input: A table with requests accepted on non-consecutive dates (e.g., `requester_id = 1, 2, 3`, `accepter_id = 2, 3, 1`, with various dates).\n   - Description: This tests if the function is correctly"

What should we do if the input array is empty or contains only one element? Should the function return zero in these cases?\n\n5. Is there a requirement for the performance of the solution, such as a time complexity constraint, given the maximum possible size of the input array (up to 10,000 elements)?"

The expected output should be `0` since there are no elements to form pairs.\n\n2. **Single Element Array**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1], k = 0`\n   - Description: Tests the case where the array contains only one element. The expected output should be `0` since a pair cannot be formed.\n\n3. **Array with All Elements the Same**:\n   - Input: `nums = [2, 2, 2, 2], k = 0`\n   - Description: Tests the case where all elements are the same and `k` is `0`. The expected output should be `1` since there is one unique pair (2, 2).\n\n4. **Array with Negative and Positive Numbers**:\n   - Input: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, 1, 2, 3], k = 2`\n   - Description: Tests the function's ability to handle both negative and positive integers. The expected output should be `4` for pairs (-1, 1), (-2, 0), (1, 3), and (2, 0).\n\n5. **Array with Duplicates and Non-Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2], k = 1`\n   - Description: Tests the function's handling of duplicates. The expected output should be `4`, as the unique pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5).\n\n6. **Maximum Size Array**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1] * 10000, k = 0`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the function with the maximum allowed size of the input array. The expected output should be `1` since all elements are the same.\n\n7. **Large k Value**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 10`\n   - Description: Tests the case where `k` is larger than the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The expected output should be `0` since no pairs can satisfy the condition.\n\n8. **k is Zero with Unique Elements**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 0`\n   - Description: Tests the case where `k` is `0` but all elements are unique.
