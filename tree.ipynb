The output should be a single tree with just that node.\n\n2. **Small Input (n = 2)**:\n   - Input: `n = 2`\n   - This checks the case with two nodes, ensuring that both possible BST configurations are generated.\n\n3. **Small Input with Three Nodes (n = 3)**:\n   - Input: `n = 3`\n   - This tests the generation of all unique BSTs for three nodes, verifying that the function can handle a small but non-trivial number of nodes.\n\n4. **Maximum Input (n = 8)**:\n   - Input: `n = 8`\n   - This tests the upper limit of the constraints.

For example, it should not return duplicate structures that are merely different representations of the same tree.\n\n8. **Edge Case with Larger Outputs**:\n   - Input: `n = 7`\n   - This tests the function's ability to handle and return a large number of unique BSTs, verifying that the output format is correct and that it does not exceed memory limits.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, performance considerations, and the need for structural uniqueness in the generated BSTs."

The main idea is to consider each number from `1` to `n` as a potential root of the BST. For each root value, we can recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees using the remaining values.",

The output should also be an empty structure.\n\n2. **Single Node Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest non-empty case where there is only one node. The next pointer should be set to `NULL`.\n\n3. **Two Levels**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a tree with two levels. The next pointers for nodes 2 and 3 should be set correctly, with node 1's next pointer remaining `NULL`.\n\n4. **Three Levels with Negative Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a perfect binary tree with negative values. Ensures that the next pointers are populated correctly despite negative values.\n\n5. **Three Levels with Duplicate Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a tree where all nodes have the same value. This checks if the function can handle duplicate values correctly while populating next pointers.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Tree**:\n   - **Input**: A perfect binary tree with `2^11 - 1 = 2047` nodes.\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and efficiency of the function at the upper limit of the constraints. It checks if the function can handle large inputs without exceeding time limits.\n\n7. **Three Levels with Zero Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a perfect binary tree where all nodes have the value zero. This case checks if the function can handle zero values correctly.\n\n8. **Unbalanced Tree Input (Invalid)**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 2, 3, 4]` (not a perfect binary tree)\n   - **Description**: Although the problem specifies a perfect binary tree, testing an invalid input can help ensure the function handles unexpected structures gracefully, potentially by throwing an error or returning an appropriate response.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations."

This tests the algorithm's ability to handle unbalanced trees.\n\n4. **Tree with Only Right Children**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, null, 2, null, 3]`\n   - **Description**: A tree that only extends to the right. Similar to the previous case, it tests handling of unbalanced trees but in the opposite direction.\n\n5. **Tree with Multiple Leaf Nodes**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [4, 9, 0, 5, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A more complex tree with multiple paths to leaf nodes. This tests the algorithm's ability to sum multiple root-to-leaf paths correctly.\n\n6. **Tree with Zero Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - **Description**: A tree where some nodes have a value of zero. This tests how the algorithm handles paths that include zeroes.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Tree**:\n   - **Input**: A complete binary tree with depth 10, where all nodes have the value `9`.\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm when processing the maximum number of nodes (up to 1000).\n\n8. **Tree with Duplicate Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A tree where all nodes have the same value. This checks if the algorithm can handle duplicate values correctly and still compute the sum accurately.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases, performance considerations, and special values that could affect the outcome of the algorithm."

The output should be a tree with a single node containing the value `5`.\n\n2. **Single Node Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [10]`, `val = 5`\n   - **Description**: Test inserting a value that is less than the single node's value. The output should be a tree where `5` is the left child of `10`.\n\n3. **Single Node Tree (Greater Value)**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [10]`, `val = 15`\n   - **Description**: Test inserting a value that is greater than the single node's value. The output should be a tree where `15` is the right child of `10`.\n\n4. **Balanced Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [4,2,6,1,3,5,7]`, `val = 0`\n   - **Description**: Test inserting a value that is less than all existing values. The output should be a tree where `0` is the left child of `1`.\n\n5. **Inserting into a Full Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [4,2,6,1,3,5,7]`, `val = 8`\n   - **Description**: Test inserting a value that is greater than all existing values. The output should be a tree where `8` is the right child of `7`.\n\n6. **Large Tree with Maximum Nodes**:\n   - **Input**: A BST with `10^4` nodes, structured as a balanced tree, and `val = 11`\n   - **Description**: Test the performance of the insertion function with the maximum number of nodes. Ensure that the function handles large inputs efficiently.\n\n7. **Negative Value Insertion**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [0,-3,9,-10,-1]`, `val = -5`\n   - **Description**: Test inserting a negative value into a tree that already contains negative values. The output should reflect the correct placement of `-5` in relation to the existing nodes.\n\n8. **Inserting Duplicate Values (Invalid Case)**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [4,2,6]`, `val = 4`\n   - **Description**: Although the problem guarantees that the value does not exist in the original BST, this test case is useful to ensure that the function correctly handles the assumption of uniqueness and does not allow duplicates.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and"

The deepest nodes are 4 and 5, and the output should be their lowest common ancestor, which is node 3.\n\n7. **Tree with Maximum Size (500 Nodes)**: \n   - Input: A large binary tree with 500 nodes structured in a way that the deepest nodes are at the last level (e.g., a complete binary tree). \n   - Description: This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution.

This checks if the algorithm correctly identifies the parent of the new node.\n\n2. **Two-Level Tree**:\n   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3]]` (initial tree with three nodes)\n   - Description: Insert a new node into a complete binary tree that is already full at the first two levels. This tests the algorithm's ability to maintain completeness while inserting at the next available position.\n\n3. **Full Three-Level Tree**:\n   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]]` (initial tree with seven nodes)\n   - Description: Insert a new node into a complete binary tree that is full at three levels. This checks if the algorithm correctly identifies the next position for insertion and maintains the complete structure.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Tree**:\n   - Input: A complete binary tree with 1000 nodes.\n   - Description: Test the performance and efficiency of the algorithm when handling the maximum number of nodes allowed. This checks if the implementation can handle larger datasets without performance degradation.\n\n5. **Inserting Duplicate Values**:\n   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3]]` followed by `insert(2)` and `insert(2)`.\n   - Description: Test the behavior of the algorithm when inserting duplicate values into the tree.

This checks the integrity of the tree after multiple modifications.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation"

This tests the simplest case where there is only one possible split.\n\n2. **All Nodes with Same Value**:\n   - Input: `root = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n   - Description: A tree where all nodes have the same value. This checks if the algorithm correctly calculates the product when all subtree sums are equal.\n\n3. **Right-Skewed Tree**:\n   - Input: `root = [1, null, 2, null, 3, null, 4]`\n   - Description: A tree that is skewed to the right. This tests how the algorithm handles unbalanced trees.\n\n4. **Left-Skewed Tree**:\n   - Input: `root = [1, 2, null, 3, null, 4]`\n   - Description: A tree that is skewed to the left. Similar to the right-skewed case, this tests the handling of unbalanced trees.\n\n5. **Maximum Size Tree**:\n   - Input: A complete binary tree with `5 * 10^4` nodes, where each node has a value of `10^4`.\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum constraints.

This tests if the algorithm can handle different values and find the optimal split.\n\n7. **Tree with Zero Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - Description: A tree where all nodes have a value of zero. This checks if the algorithm can handle cases where the sums of the subtrees are zero.\n\n8. **Tree with Large Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [10^4, 10^4, 10^4, 10^4, 10^4]`\n   - Description: A tree where all nodes have the maximum value of `10^4`.

The output should be the value of that node itself, as it is a valid BST.\n\n2. **All Negative Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [-1, -2, -3]`\n   - **Description**: A tree where all nodes have negative values. The expected output should be `0`, as no valid BST can be formed with negative sums.\n\n3. **Tree with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [2, 1, 3, null, null, 2]`\n   - **Description**: A tree that contains duplicate values. The output should consider only valid BSTs, which may exclude duplicates. The expected output is the sum of the valid BST formed by the root node `2` and its children `1` and `3`, which is `6`.\n\n4. **Left-Heavy Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A left-heavy tree where all nodes are in descending order. The expected output should be the sum of the entire tree since it is a valid BST, which is `15`.\n\n5. **Right-Heavy Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, null, 2, null, 3]`\n   - **Description**: A right-heavy tree where all nodes are in ascending order. Similar to the left-heavy case, the expected output should be the sum of the entire tree, which is `6`.\n\n6. **Complex Tree with Mixed Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [10, 5, 15, 1, 8, null, 7]`\n   - **Description**: A more complex tree that contains both valid and invalid BST subtrees. The expected output should be the maximum sum of the valid BST subtree, which in this case is `22` (from the subtree rooted at `5`).\n\n7. **Large Tree with Maximum Nodes**:\n   - **Input**: A balanced tree with `40,000` nodes where all values are distinct and in increasing order.\n   - **Description**: This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution. The expected output should be the sum of all nodes since the entire tree is a valid BST.\n\n8. **Tree with Mixed Valid and Invalid Subtrees**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [10, 5, 15, 1, 8, 12, 20, null, null, null, null"

This tests the function's ability to handle the smallest tree size.\n\n2. **Two Nodes - Target is Root**:\n   - **Input**: `tree = [2, 1], target = 2`\n   - **Description**: A tree with two nodes where the target is the root. This checks if the function correctly identifies the root node in the cloned tree.\n\n3. **Two Nodes - Target is Leaf**:\n   - **Input**: `tree = [2, 1], target = 1`\n   - **Description**: A tree with two nodes where the target is a leaf. This tests the function's ability to find a non-root node in a small tree.\n\n4. **Balanced Tree with Multiple Levels**:\n   - **Input**: `tree = [4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7], target = 5`\n   - **Description**: A balanced binary tree with multiple levels.

The expected output is `0` since there are no apples to collect.\n\n2. **Single Node with an Apple**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 1`, `edges = []`, `hasApple = [true]`\n   - **Description**: A single node that contains an apple. The expected output is `0` since you start and end at the same node, and there’s no movement required.\n\n3. **Two Nodes with One Apple**:\n   - **Input**: `n = 2`, `edges = [[0, 1]]`, `hasApple = [false, true]`\n   - **Description**: A tree with two nodes where only one has an apple.

This tests the base case where the tree has the minimum number of nodes. The expected output is `1` since the single node itself forms a pseudo-palindromic path.\n\n2. **Two Nodes with Different Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 2]`\n   - **Description**: A tree with two nodes where the values are different. This tests the case where there is only one path, which cannot be rearranged into a palindrome. The expected output is `0`.\n\n3. **Two Nodes with the Same Value**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A tree with two nodes where both have the same value. This tests the scenario where the path can be rearranged into a palindrome. The expected output is `1`.\n\n4. **Balanced Tree with Multiple Pseudo-Palindromic Paths**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [2, 3, 3, 1, 1, null, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A balanced tree with multiple paths, some of which are pseudo-palindromic. This tests the algorithm's ability to count multiple valid paths. The expected output is `2`.\n\n5. **Unbalanced Tree with No Pseudo-Palindromic Paths**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n   - **Description**: An unbalanced tree where all paths lead to unique values. This tests the scenario where there are no valid pseudo-palindromic paths. The expected output is `0`.\n\n6. **Tree with Maximum Depth**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 2, null, 3, null, 4, null, 5]` (a linear tree)\n   - **Description**: A tree that is essentially a linked list with a depth equal to the maximum number of nodes (e.g., 100,000). This tests the performance of the solution with maximum depth. The expected output will depend on the values but can be calculated based on the path.\n\n7. **Tree with All Duplicate Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: A complete binary tree where all nodes have the same value. This tests the algorithm's ability to recognize that all paths are pseudo-palindromic. The expected output is equal to the number of"

        "",
        "A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.\n\nThe kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let&#39;s define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.\n\n\nSuccessor(x, curOrder):\n    if x has no children or all of x&#39;s children are in curOrder:\n        if x is the king return null\n        else return Successor(x&#39;s parent, curOrder)\n    else return x&#39;s oldest child who&#39;s not in curOrder\n\n\nFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice&#39;s son Jack.\n\n\n\tIn the beginning, curOrder will be [&quot;king&quot;].\n\tCalling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;].\n\tCalling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;].\n\tCalling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;].\n\tCalling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;].\n\n\nUsing the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.\n\nImplement the ThroneInheritance class:\n\n\n\tThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.\n\tvoid birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.\n\tvoid death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn&#39;t affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.\n\tstring[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput\n[&quot;ThroneInheritance&quot;, &quot;birth&quot;, &quot;birth&quot;, &quot;birth&quot;, &quot;birth&quot;, &quot;birth&quot;, &quot;birth&quot;, &quot;getInheritanceOrder&quot;, &quot;death&quot;, &quot;getInheritanceOrder&quot;]\n[[&quot;king&quot;], [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;andy&quot;], [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;], [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;catherine&quot;], [&quot;andy&quot;, &quot;matthew&quot;], [&quot;bob&quot;, &quot;alex&quot;], [&quot;bob&quot;, &quot;asha&quot;], [null], [&quot;bob&quot;], [null]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;andy&quot;, &quot;matthew&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;alex&quot;, &quot;asha&quot;, &quot;catherine&quot;], null, [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;andy&quot;, &quot;matthew&quot;, &quot;alex&quot;, &quot;asha&quot;, &quot;catherine&quot;]]\n\nExplanation\nThroneInheritance t= new ThroneInheritance(&quot;king&quot;); // order: king\nt.birth(&quot;king&quot;, &quot;andy&quot;); // order: king > andy\nt.birth(&quot;king&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;); // order: king > andy > bob\nt.birth(&quot;king&quot;, &quot;catherine&quot;); // order: king > andy > bob > catherine\nt.birth(&quot;andy&quot;, &quot;matthew&quot;); // order: king > andy > matthew > bob > catherine\nt.birth(&quot;bob&quot;, &quot;alex&quot;); // order: king > andy > matthew > bob > alex > catherine\nt.birth(&quot;bob&quot;, &quot;asha&quot;); // order: king > andy > matthew > bob > alex > asha > catherine\nt.getInheritanceOrder(); // return [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;andy&quot;, &quot;matthew&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;alex&quot;, &quot;asha&quot;, &quot;catherine&quot;]\nt.death(&quot;bob&quot;); // order: king > andy > matthew > bob > alex > asha > catherine\nt.getInheritanceOrder(); // return [&quot;king&quot;, &quot;andy&quot;, &quot;matthew&quot;, &quot;alex&quot;, &quot;asha&quot;, &quot;catherine&quot;]\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= kingName.length, parentName.length, childName.length, name.length <= 15\n\tkingName, parentName, childName, and name consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\tAll arguments childName and kingName are distinct.\n\tAll name arguments of death will be passed to either the constructor or as childName to birth first.\n\tFor each call to&nbsp;birth(parentName, childName), it is guaranteed that&nbsp;parentName is alive.\n\tAt most 105 calls will be made to birth and death.\n\tAt most 10 calls will be made to getInheritanceOrder.\n\n"

The output should be a valid BST containing both nodes.\n\n3. **Two Trees with Invalid Merge**:\n   - **Input**: `trees = [[1], [3]]`\n   - **Description**: Two trees where merging is possible but results in an invalid BST. The output should be `null`.\n\n4. **Multiple Trees with Valid Merges**:\n   - **Input**: `trees = [[2, 1], [3, 2, 5], [5, 4]]`\n   - **Description**: A case similar to the example provided in the prompt, where multiple valid merges can be performed to create a valid BST.\n\n5. **Multiple Trees with No Valid Merges**:\n   - **Input**: `trees = [[5, 4], [3]]`\n   - **Description**: A situation where no merges can be performed because the values do not allow for a valid BST.

        "",
        "Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.\n\n\n\tFor example, [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;] represents the path &quot;/one/two/three&quot;.\n\n\nTwo folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.\n\n\n\tFor example, folders &quot;/a&quot; and &quot;/b&quot; in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:\n\n\t\n\t\t/a\n\t\t/a/x\n\t\t/a/x/y\n\t\t/a/z\n\t\t/b\n\t\t/b/x\n\t\t/b/x/y\n\t\t/b/z\n\t\n\t\n\tHowever, if the file structure also included the path &quot;/b/w&quot;, then the folders &quot;/a&quot; and &quot;/b&quot; would not be identical. Note that &quot;/a/x&quot; and &quot;/b/x&quot; would still be considered identical even with the added folder.\n\n\nOnce all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.\n\nReturn the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: paths = [[&quot;a&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;],[&quot;d&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;b&quot;],[&quot;d&quot;,&quot;a&quot;]]\nOutput: [[&quot;d&quot;],[&quot;d&quot;,&quot;a&quot;]]\nExplanation: The file structure is as shown.\nFolders &quot;/a&quot; and &quot;/c&quot; (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty\nfolder named &quot;b&quot;.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: paths = [[&quot;a&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;b&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;x&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;],[&quot;w&quot;],[&quot;w&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]]\nOutput: [[&quot;c&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;b&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]]\nExplanation: The file structure is as shown. \nFolders &quot;/a/b/x&quot; and &quot;/w&quot; (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named &quot;y&quot;.\nNote that folders &quot;/a&quot; and &quot;/c&quot; are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: paths = [[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;]]\nOutput: [[&quot;c&quot;],[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;],[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]]\nExplanation: All folders are unique in the file system.\nNote that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104\n\t1 <= paths[i].length <= 500\n\t1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10\n\t1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 105\n\tpath[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.\n\tNo two paths lead to the same folder.\n\tFor any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.\n\n"

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Delete Duplicate Folders in System\" problem:\n\n1. **Single Folder**:\n   - **Input**: `paths = [[\"a\"]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest case with only one folder. It should return the same folder since there are no duplicates.\n\n2. **Multiple Unique Folders**:\n   - **Input**: `paths = [[\"a\"], [\"b\"], [\"c\"]]`\n   - **Description**: All folders are unique. The output should be the same as the input, verifying that the function correctly identifies unique folders.\n\n3. **Identical Subfolder Structures**:\n   - **Input**: `paths = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"c\", \"d\"], [\"a\", \"b\", \"x\"], [\"c\", \"d\", \"y\"]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests that folders with identical subfolder structures are correctly identified. The output should exclude both `[\"a\"]` and `[\"c\"]`, as they have identical subfolder structures.\n\n4. **Nested Identical Folders**:\n   - **Input**: `paths = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"a\", \"b\", \"x\"], [\"c\", \"d\"], [\"c\", \"d\", \"y\"]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests nested identical folders. The output should exclude `[\"a\"]` and `[\"c\"]`, as they both contain identical subfolder structures.\n\n5. **Maximum Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `paths = [[\"a\"] * 500] * 20000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of input size. This will check if the function can handle large inputs without performance issues. All folders are identical, so the output should be empty.\n\n6. **Complex Structure with Non-Identical Folders**:\n   - **Input**: `paths = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"a\", \"c\"], [\"b\", \"d\"], [\"b\", \"e\"], [\"c\", \"f\"]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests a more complex structure where no folders are identical. The output should return all folders since none are duplicates.\n\n7. **Empty Subfolders**:\n   - **Input**: `paths = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"a\", \"b\", \"x\"], [\"a\", \"b\", \"y\"], [\"c\"]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests folders that have the same parent but different empty subfolders. The output should return `[\"c\"]` and any other unique folders.\n\n8. **Identical Folders with Different Paths**:\n   - **Input**: `paths = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"x\", \"y\", \"a\", \"b\"]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests if the function can identify identical folders that are located at different paths. The output should exclude both"

The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.\n\nThe data structure should support the following functions:\n\n\n\tLock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.\n\tUnlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.\n\tUpgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:\n\t\n\t\tThe node is unlocked,\n\t\tIt has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and\n\t\tIt does not have any locked ancestors.\n\t\n\t\n\n\nImplement the LockingTree class:\n\n\n\tLockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.\n\tlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise.

The upgrade operation should fail since there are locked descendants, but the node itself is locked.\n\n3. **Unlocking Non-Locked Node**:\n   - Input: \n     ```python\n     parent = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n     operations = [(\"unlock\", 2, 1)]\n     ```\n   - Description: Attempt to unlock a node that is not locked. This tests the handling of invalid unlock operations.\n\n4. **Upgrade with Locked Ancestors**:\n   - Input: \n     ```python\n     parent = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n     operations = [(\"lock\", 4, 1), (\"upgrade\", 1, 2)]\n     ```\n   - Description: Attempt to upgrade a node that has a locked ancestor. This should return false, testing the ancestor condition.\n\n5. **Upgrade with Multiple Locked Descendants**:\n   - Input: \n     ```python\n     parent = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n     operations = [(\"lock\", 4, 1), (\"lock\", 5, 2), (\"upgrade\", 0, 3)]\n     ```\n   - Description: Test upgrading a node that has multiple locked descendants. This should succeed, validating the upgrade logic.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Tree**:\n   - Input: `parent = [-1] + [0] * 1999`\n   - Description: Test the maximum constraint with a tree where all nodes are direct children of the root. This checks performance and handling of large input sizes.\n\n7. **Multiple Users Locking and Unlocking**:\n   - Input: \n     ```python\n     parent = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n     operations = [(\"lock\", 1, 1), (\"lock\", 2, 2), (\"unlock\", 1, 1), (\"lock\", 1, 3)]\n     ```\n   - Description: Test the sequence of locking and unlocking"

This should ideally return an error or a specific value indicating that the operation cannot be performed.\n\n2. **Single Node Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [5]`, `k = 1`\n   - **Description**: Test the simplest case where the tree has only one node. The output should be the value of that single node.\n\n3. **Two Nodes Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [2, 1]`, `k = 1`\n   - **Description**: Test a tree with two nodes to ensure the function correctly identifies the smallest element.\n\n4. **Balanced Tree with Multiple Nodes**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]`, `k = 4`\n   - **Description**: A balanced BST with multiple nodes. This tests the function's ability to traverse and find the kth smallest in a more complex structure.\n\n5. **Tree with Duplicate Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [5, 3, 6, 2, 4, 3]`, `k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Test a tree where duplicate values exist. This checks if the function can handle duplicates correctly and return the correct kth smallest value.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Tree**:\n   - **Input**: A BST with 10,000 nodes (e.g., a right-skewed tree with values from 1 to 10,000), `k = 10000`\n   - **Description**: Test the performance and efficiency of the solution when handling the maximum constraints.\n\n7. **Tree with Maximum Value Nodes**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [10000, 5000, 15000, 2500, 7500, 12500, 17500]`, `k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Test a tree where node values are at the upper limit of the constraints.

This checks if the function correctly calculates averages for both levels.\n\n3. **Three-Level Tree with Varying Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\n   - Description: A complete binary tree with increasing values. This tests the function's ability to handle a balanced tree and calculate averages accurately.\n\n4. **Tree with Negative Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [0, -1, -2, -3, -4]`\n   - Description: A binary tree where all node values are negative.

This checks if the function correctly computes the average when all values are identical.\n\n6. **Sparse Tree**:\n   - Input: `root = [1, null, 3, null, null, 5, 6]`\n   - Description: A sparse binary tree with some null nodes. This tests the function's ability to handle trees that are not completely filled.\n\n7. **Large Tree**:\n   - Input: A binary tree with 10,000 nodes (e.g., a complete binary tree).\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the function under maximum constraints to ensure it runs efficiently without exceeding time limits.\n\n8. **Tree with Zero Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - Description: A binary tree where all nodes have a value of zero.

The output should be a matrix with a single element.\n\n2. **Left-Heavy Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 2, null, 3]`\n   - **Description**: This tests a tree where all nodes are on the left side. It checks if the function correctly places nodes in the matrix when there are no right children.\n\n3. **Right-Heavy Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, null, 2, null, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Similar to the left-heavy case, this tests a tree where all nodes are on the right side. It ensures that the function can handle right-skewed trees correctly.\n\n4. **Balanced Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\n   - **Description**: This tests a complete binary tree where all levels are fully populated.

It checks if the function can handle large trees without performance degradation.\n\n8. **Tree with Duplicate Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n   - **Description**: This tests how the function handles trees where all node values are the same.

        "Here are 8 important test edge cases to consider for the \"Sum of Left Leaves\" problem:\n\n1. **Single Node Tree**:\n   - Input: `root = [1]`\n   - Description: Tests the simplest case where the tree has only one node (which is also a leaf). The expected output should be `0` since there are no left leaves.\n\n2. **Tree with Only Right Children**:\n   - Input: `root = [1,null,2,null,3]`\n   - Description: A tree where all nodes are right children. This tests the scenario where there are no left leaves. The expected output should be `0`.\n\n3. **Tree with Only Left Children**:\n   - Input: `root = [1,2,null,3]`\n   - Description: A tree where all nodes are left children. This tests the case where the only leaf is a left leaf. The expected output should be `3`.\n\n4. **Tree with Mixed Children**:\n   - Input: `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`\n   - Description: A balanced tree with both left and right leaves. This is a standard case where the expected output should be `24` (sum of left leaves 9 and 15).\n\n5. **Tree with Negative Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [-1,-2,-3,null,null,-4,-5]`\n   - Description: A tree that includes negative values. This tests if the function correctly sums negative left leaves. The expected output should be `-6` (sum of left leaves -2 and -4).\n\n6. **Tree with Duplicate Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [1,1,1,null,null,1,1]`\n   - Description: A tree where all nodes have the same value. This tests if the function can handle duplicates correctly. The expected output should be `1` (the left leaf is the left child of the right subtree).\n\n7. **Large Tree**:\n   - Input: A complete binary tree with 1000 nodes where every left leaf has a value of `1` and every right leaf has a value of `0`.\n   - Description: Tests the performance and efficiency of the function with the maximum number of nodes. The expected output should be the count of left leaves, which would be `500` in this case.\n\n8. **Tree with No Leaves**:\n   - Input: `root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`\n   - Description: A complete binary tree where all nodes have children. This tests the scenario where there are no left leaves. The expected output should be `0`.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases related to tree structure, node values, and performance considerations."

        "Given a n * n matrix grid of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.\n\nReturn the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\n\n\tval: True if the node represents a grid of 1&#39;s or False if the node represents a grid of 0&#39;s. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\n\tisLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.\n\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\n\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\n\n\tIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1&#39;s or all 0&#39;s) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n\tIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\n\tRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\n\nQuad-Tree format:\n\nYou don&#39;t need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\n\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:\nNotice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nExplanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.\nThe topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.\nThe topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.\nExplanation is shown in the photo below:\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == grid.length == grid[i].length\n\tn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 6\n\n"

This checks if the algorithm correctly handles negative sums and identifies the most frequent subtree sum.\n\n3. **Mixed Values with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `root = [5, 2, -5, 2, 2]`\n   - Description: A tree where some values are duplicated. This tests the algorithm's ability to count and return the most frequent sums correctly.\n\n4. **Large Tree with Maximum Nodes**:\n   - Input: A balanced binary tree with 10,000 nodes, where all nodes have the value `1`.\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum constraints and checks if it can handle large input sizes efficiently.\n\n5. **Zero Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [0, 0, 0]`\n   - Description: A tree where all node values are zero. This checks if the algorithm can handle zero sums and recognize that the most frequent sum is zero.\n\n6. **Tree with Varying Values Leading to Ties**:\n   - Input: `root = [1, 2, -1, 3, -2, -3]`\n   - Description: A tree where multiple subtree sums occur with the same frequency. This tests if the algorithm can return all values with the highest frequency correctly.\n\n7. **Tree with Large Positive and Negative Values**:\n   - Input: `root = [100000, -100000, 0, 50000, -50000]`\n   - Description: A tree containing extreme positive and negative values. This checks if the algorithm can handle large sums and correctly identify the most frequent ones.\n\n8. **Unbalanced Tree**:\n   - Input: `root = [1, 2, 3, 4, null, null, 5]`\n   - Description: An unbalanced tree where one side is deeper than the other. This tests the algorithm's ability to compute subtree sums accurately in non-symmetric structures. \n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a robust evaluation of the solution."

        "A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.\n\nGiven quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix.\n\nReturn a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.\n\nNotice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\n\n\tval: True if the node represents a grid of 1&#39;s or False if the node represents a grid of 0&#39;s.\n\tisLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\n\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\n\n\tIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1&#39;s or all 0&#39;s) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n\tIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\n\tRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\n\nQuad-Tree format:\n\nThe input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\n\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n \n\nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.\nIf we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.\nNotice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don&#39;t have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: quadTree1 = [[1,0]], quadTree2 = [[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,0]]\nExplanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.\nThe resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tquadTree1 and quadTree2 are both valid Quad-Trees each representing a n * n grid.\n\tn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 9.\n\n"

        "",
        "Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n\n\t\n\tNode Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.\n\t\n\t\n\tParentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:\n\n\t\n\t\tIf a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node&#39;s value.\n\t\tIf a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tOmitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.\n\n\tIn summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree&#39;s structure accurately.\n\t\n\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: &quot;1(2(4))(3)&quot;\nExplanation: Originally, it needs to be &quot;1(2(4)())(3()())&quot;, but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be &quot;1(2(4))(3)&quot;.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4]\nOutput: &quot;1(2()(4))(3)&quot;\nExplanation: Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n\t-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n"

This tests the simplest non-empty case.\n\n3. **Two Nodes (Left Child)**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [5, 3]`\n   - **Description**: A tree with a root and one left child. This tests the conversion logic when there are only two nodes, ensuring that the left child's value is updated correctly.\n\n4. **Two Nodes (Right Child)**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [5, null, 7]`\n   - **Description**: A tree with a root and one right child. Similar to the previous case, but tests the right child scenario.\n\n5. **Balanced Tree**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]`\n   - **Description**: A balanced BST with multiple levels. This tests the algorithm's ability to traverse and convert a more complex structure.\n\n6. **Tree with Negative Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [-3, -4, -1, -5, -2]`\n   - **Description**: A tree containing negative values. This tests how the algorithm handles negative numbers and ensures that the logic for summing values works correctly.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Tree**:\n   - **Input**: A tree with 10,000 nodes, structured as a right-skewed tree (e.g., `root = [1, null, 2, null, 3, ..., 10000]`).\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance and efficiency of the algorithm when handling the upper limit of the input size.\n\n8. **Tree with All Nodes Having Large Values**:\n   - **Input**: `root = [10000, 9999, 9998, ..., 9990]` (a left-skewed tree).\n   - **Description**: A tree where all nodes have large values close to the upper limit of the constraints. This tests the algorithm's ability to handle large integer values and ensure no overflow occurs during summation.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, which are essential for thoroughly testing the solution to the problem."
