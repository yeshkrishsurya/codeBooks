Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:\n\n\n\tIf the value does not start with 4 or&nbsp;9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.\n\tIf the value starts with 4 or 9 use the&nbsp;subtractive form&nbsp;representing&nbsp;one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example,&nbsp;4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV&nbsp;and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX.&nbsp;Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX),&nbsp;40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).\n\tOnly powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5&nbsp;(V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol&nbsp;4 times&nbsp;use the subtractive form.\n\n\nGiven an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: num = 3749\n\nOutput: &quot;MMMDCCXLIX&quot;\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)\n 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)\n  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)\n   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)\nNote: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: num = 58\n\nOutput: &quot;LVIII&quot;\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n50 = L\n 8 = VIII\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: num = 1994\n\nOutput: &quot;MCMXCIV&quot;\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n1000 = M\n 900 = CM\n  90 = XC\n   4 = IV\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= num <= 3999"

The first element allows a jump to the last index, so the output should be true.\n\n4. **All Zeros Except First Element**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1] + [0]*9999`\n   - Description: This tests the scenario where the first jump is possible but all subsequent jumps are blocked. The output should be false.\n\n5. **Multiple Paths to Last Index**:\n   - Input: `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`\n   - Description: This is a standard case where multiple paths can lead to the last index. The output should be true.\n\n6. **Stuck at a Zero**:\n   - Input: `nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]`\n   - Description: This tests the case where you can reach a point (index 3) that has a jump length of 0, making it impossible to reach the last index. The output should be false.\n\n7. **Large Array with Random Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] * 1000`\n   - Description: This tests the performance of the solution with the maximum size of the array filled with increasing values. The output should be true as you can always jump to the end.\n\n8. **Alternating Large and Small Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 100, 1, 100, 1, 100, 1, 100, 0]`\n   - Description: This tests a case where you can jump far but are ultimately blocked by a zero at the end. The output should be false as you cannot reach the last index.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of edge conditions, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations."

The expected output should be 2, as we only need to select two numbers from the repeated intervals.\n\n7. **Intervals with Maximum Range**:\n   - **Input**: `intervals = [[0, 100000000], [99999999, 100000000]]`\n   - **Description**: Intervals that cover a very large range. This tests how the algorithm handles large values. The expected output should be 4, as we can select two numbers from each interval.\n\n8. **Intervals with Gaps**:\n   - **Input**: `intervals = [[1, 2], [5, 6], [8, 9]]`\n   - **Description**: Intervals that have gaps between them. The expected output should be 6, as we need to select two numbers from each of the three intervals.\n\nThese edge cases cover a variety of scenarios, including boundary conditions, performance limits, and special cases that could affect the correctness"

This tests if the algorithm correctly identifies that no swaps are needed.\n\n3. **All Couples Separated by One Seat**:\n   - **Input**: `row = [0, 2, 1, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Each couple is separated by one person. This tests the algorithm's ability to determine the minimum swaps needed (should return 1).\n\n4. **Maximum Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `row = [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 58, 59]` (for n = 30)\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum constraints.

This tests the algorithm's handling of more complex arrangements that require multiple swaps.\n\n8. **All Couples in Random Order**:\n   - **Input**: `row = [3, 1, 0, 2]`\n   - **Description**: Couples are seated in a completely random order.

The output should be `true` since an empty hand can be considered as having no groups.\n\n2. **Single Card**:\n   - **Input**: `hand = [5], groupSize = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the simplest non-empty case. The output should be `true` because a single card can form a group of size 1.\n\n3. **Insufficient Cards for Group Size**:\n   - **Input**: `hand = [1, 2, 3], groupSize = 4`\n   - **Description**: Tests a scenario where the number of cards is less than the required group size. The output should be `false`.\n\n4. **All Cards the Same**:\n   - **Input**: `hand = [2, 2, 2, 2], groupSize = 2`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case where all cards have the same value. The output should be `true` since pairs of the same card can be formed.\n\n5. **Consecutive Cards with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `hand = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], groupSize = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests a case with duplicates but still allows for valid grouping.

The student should sit at seat 0, leave, and then the next call to `seat()` should again return 0.\n\n2. **Two Seats (n = 2)**:\n   - Input: `ExamRoom(2)`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `leave(0)`, `seat()`\n   - Description: Test a room with two seats. The first student should sit at seat 0, the second at seat 1, and after leaving seat 0, the next student should sit at seat 0 again.\n\n3. **Multiple Students with Alternating Leaves**:\n   - Input: `ExamRoom(10)`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `leave(0)`, `seat()`, `leave(9)`, `seat()`\n   - Description: Simulate a scenario where students sit and leave alternately. This tests the ability to handle dynamic seating and ensure the algorithm correctly finds the optimal seat after each leave.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Room (n = 10^9)**:\n   - Input: `ExamRoom(1000000000)`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `leave(0)`, `seat()`\n   - Description: Test the performance and memory handling of the implementation with the maximum constraint for `n`. Ensure that the algorithm can handle large values without performance degradation.\n\n5. **All Seats Taken and One Leaves**:\n   - Input: `ExamRoom(5)`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `leave(2)`, `seat()`\n   - Description: Fill all seats and then leave one in the middle. This will test if the algorithm can correctly identify the best seat to maximize distance after a seat is freed.\n\n6. **Sequential Leaves**:\n   - Input: `ExamRoom(5)`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `seat()`, `leave(1)`, `leave(0)`, `seat()`\n   - Description: Test the scenario where students leave in the order they were seated. This checks if the algorithm can handle multiple leaves in quick succession and still find the optimal seat.\n\n7. **Repeated Seating and Leaving**:\n   - Input: `ExamRoom(10)`, `seat()`, `leave(0)`, `seat()`, `leave(1)`, `seat()`, `leave(0)`, `seat()`\n   - Description: Continuously seat and leave students in a pattern to ensure that the system can handle repeated actions correctly"

        "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).

You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.\n\nNote that you do not have any change in hand at first.\n\nGiven an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nFrom the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.\nFrom the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.\nFrom the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\nSince all customers got correct change, we output true.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: \nFrom the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.\nFor the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.\nFor the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.\nSince not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= bills.length <= 105\n\tbills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.\n\n"

In one move, you can play an unplayed token in one of the two ways (but not both for the same token):\n\n\n\tFace-up: If your current power is at least tokens[i], you may play tokeni, losing tokens[i] power and gaining 1 score.\n\tFace-down: If your current score is at least 1, you may play tokeni, gaining tokens[i] power and losing 1 score.\n\n\nReturn the maximum possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n<div class=\"example-block\" style=\"\n    border-color: var(--border-tertiary);\n    border-left-width: 2px;\n    color: var(--text-secondary);\n    font-size: .875rem;\n    margin-bottom: 1rem;\n    margin-top: 1rem;\n    overflow: visible;\n    padding-left: 1rem;\n\">\nInput: <span class=\"example-io\" style=\"\n    font-family: Menlo,sans-serif;\n    font-size: 0.85rem;\n\">tokens = [100], power = 50\n\nOutput: <span class=\"example-io\" style=\"\n    font-family: Menlo,sans-serif;\n    font-size: 0.85rem;\n\">0\n\nExplanation: Since your score is 0 initially, you cannot play the token face-down.

The expected output should be `0` since no tokens can be played.\n\n2. **Single Token with Insufficient Power**:\n   - **Input**: `tokens = [50], power = 30`\n   - **Description**: Test with a single token that cannot be played face-up due to insufficient power. The expected output should be `0`.\n\n3. **Single Token with Sufficient Power**:\n   - **Input**: `tokens = [50], power = 50`\n   - **Description**: Test with a single token that can be played face-up. The expected output should be `1`, as the player can gain one score.\n\n4. **All Tokens Playable Face-Up**:\n   - **Input**: `tokens = [10, 20, 30, 40], power = 100`\n   - **Description**: Test with multiple tokens where all can be played face-up.

        "Here are 8 important edge cases to consider when solving the problem of Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips:\n\n1. **Single Element Array (All Zeros)**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0], k = 1`\n   - Description: The smallest possible input where the array contains only one element that is 0. This tests the basic functionality of flipping a single bit.\n\n2. **Single Element Array (All Ones)**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1], k = 1`\n   - Description: The smallest possible input where the array contains only one element that is 1. This checks if the function correctly identifies that no flips are needed.\n\n3. **All Zeros with k Equal to Length**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 0, 0, 0], k = 4`\n   - Description: An array of zeros where k equals the length of the array. This tests if the function can flip the entire array in one operation.\n\n4. **All Ones with k Equal to Length**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1], k = 4`\n   - Description: An array of ones where k equals the length of the array. This checks if the function correctly identifies that no flips are needed.\n\n5. **Impossible Case with k Greater than Array Length**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 0, 0], k = 4`\n   - Description: An array of zeros where k is greater than the length of the array. This tests if the function returns -1 when it’s impossible to flip.\n\n6. **Alternating Bits**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], k = 2`\n   - Description: An array with alternating bits. This tests the function's ability to handle patterns and determine the minimum flips required.\n\n7. **Maximum Size Array**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0] * 100000, k = 1`\n   - Description: An array of maximum size (100,000) filled with zeros and k set to 1. This tests the performance and efficiency of the solution under maximum constraints.\n\n8. **Flipping Required in the Middle**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], k = 3`\n   - Description: An array where flips are required in the middle. This tests the function's ability to handle non-trivial cases where multiple flips are needed to achieve the goal.\n\nThese edge cases cover a range of scenarios, including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations, ensuring a comprehensive test of the solution's robustness."

The expected output is an empty string, which checks if the function can handle the absence of characters.\n\n2. **Single Character**:\n   - **Input**: `a = 1, b = 0`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case where there is only one character, which should return a string with a single 'a'. It checks if the function can handle minimal input correctly.\n\n3. **Two Characters**:\n   - **Input**: `a = 0, b = 2`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case where there are two 'b's and no 'a's. The expected output is \"bb\". This checks if the function can handle small inputs with only one type of character.\n\n4. **Equal Counts**:\n   - **Input**: `a = 3, b = 3`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case with equal counts of 'a' and 'b'. The function should return a valid string such as \"ababab\" or \"aabab\". It checks if the function can balance the characters correctly.\n\n5. **One More 'a' than 'b'**:\n   - **Input**: `a = 4, b = 3`\n   - **Description**: This tests a scenario where there is one more 'a' than 'b'. The expected output could be \"abababa\" or \"aababa\". This checks the function's ability to distribute characters without forming invalid substrings.\n\n6. **One More 'b' than 'a'**:\n   - **Input**: `a = 3, b = 4`\n   - **Description**: Similar to the previous case but with one more 'b'. The expected output could be \"bababab\" or \"bbababa\". This checks the function's ability to handle the reverse imbalance.\n\n7. **Maximum Size**:\n   - **Input**: `a = 100, b = 100`\n   - **Description**: This tests the upper limit of the constraints. The function should return a valid string of length 200 without 'aaa' or 'bbb'. This checks performance and efficiency with maximum input sizes.\n\n8. **Imbalanced Counts**:\n   - **Input**: `a = 5, b = 0`\n   - **Description**: This tests the case where all characters are 'a' and none are 'b'. The expected output should be \"aaaaa\", which checks if the function can handle a situation where one character type is completely absent.\n\nThese edge cases cover a"

The expected output should be `0` since there are no elements to negate.\n\n2. **Single Element Array (Positive)**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [5], k = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with a single positive element. The expected output should be `-5` since negating the only element will yield a negative sum.\n\n3. **Single Element Array (Negative)**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-3], k = 1`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with a single negative element. The expected output should be `3` since negating the element will yield a positive sum.\n\n4. **All Elements Negative**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4], k = 4`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where all elements are negative and `k` is equal to the length of the array. The expected output should be `10` since all elements can be negated.\n\n5. **More Negations than Elements**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where `k` is greater than the number of elements in the array. The expected output should be `3` since after negating all elements, the sum will be `0`, and two additional negations will not change the sum.\n\n6. **Mixed Values with Zero**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [0, -1, 2, -3], k = 2`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case with a mix of positive, negative, and zero values. The expected output should be `6` since negating `-1` and `-3` will yield `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.\n\n7. **Duplicates with Negations**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [2, 2, -2, -2], k = 3`\n   - **Description**: Tests the behavior with duplicate values and an odd number of negations. The expected output should be `8` since negating one `-2` and one `2` will yield `[2, 2, 2, -2]`.\n\n8. **Maximum Size Array**:\n   - **Input**: `nums = [1] * 10000, k = 10000`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance with the maximum size of the array"

This tests the function's ability to handle the minimum constraints.\n\n2. **Equal Costs**:\n   - **Input**: `costs = [[100, 100], [100, 100], [100, 100], [100, 100]]`\n   - **Description**: All costs are the same. This tests if the function can handle cases where the choice of city does not affect the total cost.\n\n3. **Maximum Input Size**:\n   - **Input**: `costs = [[1, 1000]] * 100`\n   - **Description**: Tests the upper limit of the input size with 100 pairs where one city is significantly cheaper than the other. This checks performance and correctness under maximum constraints.\n\n4. **High Variance in Costs**:\n   - **Input**: `costs = [[1, 1000], [1000, 1], [1, 1000], [1000, 1]]`\n   - **Description**: Alternating costs where one city is extremely cheap for some people and extremely expensive for others.

This tests if the function can correctly identify that all should go to city A without mistakenly splitting them.\n\n6. **Negative Costs (Invalid Input)**:\n   - **Input**: `costs = [[-1, 2], [3, -4]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests how the function handles negative costs, which should not be valid according to the problem constraints. This checks for input validation.\n\n7. **Duplicate Costs**:\n   - **Input**: `costs = [[100, 200], [100, 200], [200, 100], [200, 100]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the function's ability to handle duplicate cost pairs and still return the correct minimum cost.\n\n8. **Performance with Large Differences**:\n   - **Input**: `costs = [[1, 1000], [2, 999], [3, 998], [4, 997], [5, 996], [6, 995], [7, 994], [8, 993]]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the algorithm's efficiency when there"

A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.&nbsp;\n\nNote that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be&nbsp;unique.

However, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.&nbsp;\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]\nOutput: [7,7,6] \nExplanation: The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions.

The output should be the element itself since it is the only possible subsequence.\n\n2. **All Elements Equal**:\n   - Input: `nums = [3, 3, 3, 3]`\n   - Description: An array where all elements are the same. This tests if the solution can handle duplicates correctly and still find a valid subsequence.\n\n3. **Two Elements, Equal Sum**:\n   - Input: `nums = [2, 2]`\n   - Description: A case where the sum of the two elements is equal, which should lead to a subsequence that includes both elements to satisfy the condition.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Array with Maximum Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [100] * 500`\n   - Description: Tests the performance of the solution with the maximum constraints, where all elements are at their maximum value. It checks if the algorithm can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n5. **Mixed Values with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`\n   - Description: A case with mixed values and duplicates to ensure the algorithm correctly identifies the minimal subsequence that meets the criteria.\n\n6. **Descending Order with One Element Required**:\n   - Input: `nums = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]`\n   - Description: A descending order array where the largest element alone is sufficient to exceed the sum of the rest. This tests if the algorithm can correctly identify the minimal subsequence.\n\n7. **Edge Case with Zero**:\n   - Input: `nums = [0, 1, 2, 3]`\n   - Description: Although the problem states that `1 <= nums[i]`, this case is useful to understand how the algorithm behaves with lower boundary values (if allowed). It checks if the algorithm can handle zero correctly.\n\n8. **Large Array with Mixed Values**:\n   - Input: `nums = [1, 100, 2, 99, 3, 98, 4, 97, 5, 96]`\n   - Description: A larger array with a mix of high and low values, testing the algorithm's ability to find the optimal subsequence among varied values.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases, performance limits, and special conditions that could affect the outcome of the solution."

        "You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.\n\nYou are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.\n\nYou can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.\n\nReturn the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return -1.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.\n1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.\n2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.\n3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.\nThe highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: customers = [10,9,6], boardingCost = 6, runningCost = 4\nOutput: 7\nExplanation:\n1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $6 - 1 * $4 = $20.\n2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.\n3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.\n4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.\n5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.\n6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.\n7. 1 boards, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 25 * $6 - 7 * $4 = $122.\nThe highest profit was $122 after rotating the wheel 7 times.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: customers = [3,4,0,5,1], boardingCost = 1, runningCost = 92\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\n1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates.

Current profit is 7 * $1 - 2 * $92 = -$177.\n3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 3 * $92 = -$269.\n4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $1 - 4 * $92 = -$357.\n5. 1 customer arrives, 2 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates.

Tests the basic functionality of the algorithm.\n\n2. **Single Task with High Minimum Energy**:\n   - Input: `tasks = [[1, 10000]]`\n   - Description: A single task requiring a large minimum energy. This tests if the algorithm can handle high values and still return the correct initial energy.\n\n3. **Multiple Tasks with Increasing Minimum Energy**:\n   - Input: `tasks = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 8]]`\n   - Description: Tasks that require increasing minimum energy. This tests if the algorithm can correctly compute the initial energy needed when tasks are ordered by their minimum requirements.\n\n4. **Tasks with Equal Actual and Minimum Energy**:\n   - Input: `tasks = [[5, 5], [10, 10], [15, 15]]`\n   - Description: All tasks have the same actual and minimum energy.

It checks if the algorithm can handle large inputs efficiently without timing out or running out of memory.\n\n7. **Tasks with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `tasks = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]`\n   - Description: Multiple tasks with the same actual and minimum energy.

This tests if the algorithm can correctly calculate the total energy needed when tasks cannot be completed in a straightforward manner.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases related to input size, value ranges, and task configurations, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's correctness and performance."

        "You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.\n\nYou are given an array boxes, where boxes[i] = [ports​​i​, weighti], and three integers portsCount, maxBoxes, and maxWeight.\n\n\n\tports​​i is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is the weight of the ith box.\n\tportsCount is the number of ports.\n\tmaxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.\n\n\nThe boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:\n\n\n\tThe ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.\n\tFor each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.\n\tThe ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.\n\n\nThe ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.\n\nReturn the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: \n- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.\nSo the total number of trips is 4.\nNote that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: \n- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\nSo the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:\n- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\nSo the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= boxes.length <= 105\n\t1 <= portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight <= 105\n\t1 <= ports​​i <= portsCount\n\t1 <= weightsi <= maxWeight\n\n"

        "You are given two strings word1 and word2. You want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:\n\n\n\tIf word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.\n\n\t\n\t\tFor example, if word1 = &quot;abc&quot; and merge = &quot;dv&quot;, then after choosing this operation, word1 = &quot;bc&quot; and merge = &quot;dva&quot;.\n\t\n\t\n\tIf word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.\n\t\n\t\tFor example, if word2 = &quot;abc&quot; and merge = &quot;&quot;, then after choosing this operation, word2 = &quot;bc&quot; and merge = &quot;a&quot;.\n\t\n\t\n\n\nReturn the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.\n\nA string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. For example, &quot;abcd&quot; is lexicographically larger than &quot;abcc&quot; because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: word1 = &quot;cabaa&quot;, word2 = &quot;bcaaa&quot;\nOutput: &quot;cbcabaaaaa&quot;\nExplanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:\n- Take from word1: merge = &quot;c&quot;, word1 = &quot;abaa&quot;, word2 = &quot;bcaaa&quot;\n- Take from word2: merge = &quot;cb&quot;, word1 = &quot;abaa&quot;, word2 = &quot;caaa&quot;\n- Take from word2: merge = &quot;cbc&quot;, word1 = &quot;abaa&quot;, word2 = &quot;aaa&quot;\n- Take from word1: merge = &quot;cbca&quot;, word1 = &quot;baa&quot;, word2 = &quot;aaa&quot;\n- Take from word1: merge = &quot;cbcab&quot;, word1 = &quot;aa&quot;, word2 = &quot;aaa&quot;\n- Append the remaining 5 a&#39;s from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: word1 = &quot;abcabc&quot;, word2 = &quot;abdcaba&quot;\nOutput: &quot;abdcabcabcaba&quot;\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000\n\tword1 and word2 consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\n"

The expected output should also be an empty string.\n\n2. **One String Empty**:\n   - Input: `word1 = \"abc\"`, `word2 = \"\"`\n   - Description: Tests the case where one string is empty, and the other is non-empty. The output should be the non-empty string itself.\n\n3. **Single Character Strings**:\n   - Input: `word1 = \"a\"`, `word2 = \"b\"`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario with the smallest non-empty strings. The expected output should be \"ba\" since 'b' is lexicographically larger than 'a'.\n\n4. **Identical Strings**:\n   - Input: `word1 = \"abc\"`, `word2 = \"abc\"`\n   - Description: Tests the case where both strings are identical. The expected output should be \"abcabc\" as the merge can take characters from either string.\n\n5. **Strings with Duplicates**:\n   - Input: `word1 = \"aabb\"`, `word2 = \"abab\"`\n   - Description: Tests how the function handles strings with duplicate characters. The expected output should be \"ababab\" since it can alternate between the two strings to form the largest merge.\n\n6. **Maximum Length Strings**:\n   - Input: `word1 = \"a\" * 3000`, `word2 = \"b\" * 3000`\n   - Description: Tests the performance and efficiency of the solution with the maximum allowed string lengths. The expected output should be \"b\" repeated 3000 times followed by \"a\" repeated 3000 times.\n\n7. **Lexicographically Ordered Strings**:\n   - Input: `word1 = \"xyz\"`, `word2 = \"abc\"`\n   - Description: Tests the case where one string is lexicographically larger than the other. The expected output should be \"xyzabc\" since 'x', 'y', 'z' are larger than 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n8. **Interleaved Characters**:\n   - Input: `word1 = \"ace\"`, `word2 = \"bdf\"`\n   - Description: Tests the scenario where characters are interleaved in a way that both strings contribute to the merge. The expected output should be \"bdface\" as it takes 'b', then 'd', then 'f', followed by 'a', 'c', and 'e'.\n\nThese test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases related to string lengths, content, and performance considerations."

This tests if the function can correctly distribute extra students to maximize the overall average when the ratios are equal.\n\n4. **Maximum Size Input**:\n   - Input: `classes = [[1, 1]] * 100000, extraStudents = 100000`\n   - Description: Tests the function's performance with the maximum constraints, where all classes are the same and have the minimum number of students.\n\n5. **All Classes with Maximum Students**:\n   - Input: `classes = [[100000, 100000]] * 100000, extraStudents = 100000`\n   - Description: Tests the function's ability to handle classes at the upper limit of student counts, ensuring it can compute averages correctly without overflow.\n\n6. **Classes with Varying Pass Rates**:\n   - Input: `classes = [[1, 2], [3, 5], [2, 2], [4, 10]], extraStudents = 1`\n   - Description: Classes have different pass rates, and only one extra student is available. This checks if the function can prioritize the best class for the extra student.\n\n7. **Extra Students Exceed Total Students**:\n   - Input: `classes = [[1, 2], [2, 4]], extraStudents = 10`\n   - Description: More extra students than total students across all classes. This tests how the function handles scenarios where there are more extra students than can be effectively utilized.\n\n8. **Classes with Duplicate Ratios**:\n   - Input: `classes = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 4], [2, 4]], extraStudents = 2`\n   - Description: Classes with duplicate ratios. This tests whether the function can handle and optimize the distribution of extra students among classes with the same pass ratio.\n\nThese test cases cover a range of boundary conditions, special values, and performance scenarios"

The expected output should be `0`.\n\n4. **All Ice Cream Bars Too Expensive**:\n   - **Input**: `costs = [10, 20, 30], coins = 5`\n   - **Description**: Tests the scenario where all ice cream bars are more expensive than the available coins.

The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.\n\nYou want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.\n\n\n\tFor example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.\n\n\nReturn the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or -1 if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[4,8],[2,8]]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: It is optimal to choose the first supplier, using two size-4 boxes and one size-8 box.\nThe total waste is (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There is no box that the package of size 5 can fit in.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: packages = [3,5,8,10,11,12], boxes = [[12],[11,9],[10,5,14]]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: It is optimal to choose the third supplier, using two size-5 boxes, two size-10 boxes, and two size-14 boxes.\nThe total waste is (5-3) + (5-5) + (10-8) + (10-10) + (14-11) + (14-12) = 9.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == packages.length\n\tm == boxes.length\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t1 <= m <= 105\n\t1 <= packages[i] <= 105\n\t1 <= boxes[j].length <= 105\n\t1 <= boxes[j][k] <= 105\n\tsum(boxes[j].length) <= 105\n\tThe elements in boxes[j] are distinct.\n\n"

This checks if the solution can handle large input sizes efficiently.

Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.\n\nYou are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.\n\nInitially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.\n\nPick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.\n\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.\nAfter finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.\nWith capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.\nSince you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.\nTherefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]\nOutput: 6\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= k <= 105\n\t0 <= w <= 109\n\tn == profits.length\n\tn == capital.length\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t0 <= profits[i] <= 104\n\t0 <= capital[i] <= 109\n\n"

This tests the function's handling of minimal input.\n\n2. **Single Project with Insufficient Capital**:\n   - **Input**: `k = 1, w = 0, profits = [10], capital = [1]`\n   - **Description**: A scenario where the initial capital is not enough to start any project. The expected output should be the initial capital, which is 0.\n\n3. **Single Project with Sufficient Capital**:\n   - **Input**: `k = 1, w = 5, profits = [10], capital = [1]`\n   - **Description**: A single project that can be completed with the available capital. This tests if the function correctly processes a straightforward case.\n\n4. **All Projects Require More Capital than Available**:\n   - **Input**: `k = 2, w = 0, profits = [5, 10, 15], capital = [1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Description**: None of the projects can be started due to insufficient initial capital.

The maximum profit should be the difference between the first and last prices, which is `4`.\n\n5. **Prices with Duplicates**:\n   - **Input**: `prices = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where all prices are the same. No profit can be made, so the expected output should be `0`.\n\n6. **Maximum Size Array with Random Values**:\n   - **Input**: `prices = [i for i in range(1, 100001)]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the performance of the algorithm with the maximum allowed size of the array. The expected output should be `99999` (buy at price `1` and sell at price `100000`).\n\n7. **Prices with a Single Peak**:\n   - **Input**: `prices = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the case where prices increase to a peak and then decrease. The maximum profit should be `2` (buy at `1` and sell at `3`).\n\n8. **Prices with Multiple Peaks and Valleys**:\n   - **Input**: `prices = [5, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3]`\n   - **Description**: Tests the algorithm's ability to find the optimal buy and sell days amidst fluctuations. The expected output should be `5` (buy at `1` and sell at `6`).\n\nThese edge cases cover various scenarios including boundary conditions, special values, and performance considerations that are essential for robust testing of the solution."
